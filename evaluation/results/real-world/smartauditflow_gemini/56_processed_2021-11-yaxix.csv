 Precision issue function `_tokensToShares`
Submitted by WatchPug
The actual token withdrawn from `vault.withdraw()` will most certainly less than the _amount, due to precision loss in _tokensToShares() and vault.withdraw().
As a result, IDetailedERC20(_token).safeTransfer(_recipient, _amount) will revert due to insufficant balance.
Based on the simulation we ran, it will fail 99.99% of the time unless the pps == 1e18.

}",216.3876891136169,3383.0,37.0,"### **[H-01] YaxisVaultAdapter.sol#withdraw() will most certainly fail**

**Report Description**:
The `withdraw()` function in `YaxisVaultAdapter.sol` is likely to fail due to precision loss in the `_tokensToShares()` function and the `vault.withdraw()` function. The actual tokens withdrawn from the vault will almost certainly be less than the specified `_amount`, causing the subsequent `safeTransfer` call to revert due to insufficient balance. This issue is highly probable (99.99% failure rate) unless the price per share (`pps`) equals `1e18`. The problem arises from the order of operations in `_tokensToShares()` and the reliance on `vault.getPricePerFullShare()`.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Rounding Errors in `_sharesToTokens` and `_tokensToShares` Functions""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the issue of rounding errors in the `_tokensToShares` function, which is relevant to the precision loss described in the issue. However, the response does not fully capture the critical impact of this precision loss on the `withdraw()` function, specifically the high likelihood of failure due to insufficient balance in the `safeTransfer` call. The response also misses the broader context of the issue, such as the reliance on `vault.getPricePerFullShare()` and the specific failure scenario described in the report.

### **Detailed Analysis**

The issue report highlights a critical flaw in the `withdraw()` function of `YaxisVaultAdapter.sol`, where precision loss in the `_tokensToShares()` function and the `vault.withdraw()` function leads to a high probability of failure. The response list partially addresses this issue under the ""Rounding Errors in `_sharesToTokens` and `_tokensToShares` Functions"" entry, but it does not fully capture the severity or the specific failure scenario described in the report. The response correctly identifies the rounding error problem but misses the broader implications and the high likelihood of the `withdraw()` function failing due to insufficient balance in the `safeTransfer` call. This gap in the response indicates a need for a more comprehensive analysis of the issue, including its impact on the contract's functionality and potential solutions to mitigate the risk.","```
