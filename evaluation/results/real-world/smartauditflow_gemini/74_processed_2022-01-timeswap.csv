}",3200,378,"[H-01] TimeswapPair.sol#borrow() Improper implementation allows attacker to increase pool.state.z to a large value

In the current implementation, `borrow()` takes a user input value of zIncrease, while the actual collateral asset transferred in is calculated at L319, the state of pool.state.z still increased by the value of the user's input at L332.
Even though a large number of zIncrease means that the user needs to add more collateral, the attacker can use a dust amount xDecrease (1 wei for example) so that the total collateral needed is rather small.
Plus, the attacker can always pay() the dust amount of loan to get back the rather large amount of collateral added.

  [H-03] Manipulation of the Y State Results in Interest Rate Manipulation
 mint function 
Submitted by Rhynorater, also found by harleythedog, hyh, and WatchPug
Due to lack of constraints on user input in the TimeswapPair.sol#mint function, an attacker can arbitrarily modify the interest rate while only paying a minimal amount of Asset Token and Collateral Token.
Disclosure: This is my first time attempting Ethereum hacking, so I might have made some mistakes here since the math is quite complex, but I'm going to give it a go.

  [H-04] Important state updates are made after the callback in the mint() function

Submitted by jayjonah8
In TimeswapPair.sol, the `mint()` function has a callback in the middle of the function while there are still updates to state that take place after the callback. The lock modifier guards against reentrancy but not against cross function reentrancy. Since the protocol implements Uniswap like functionality, this can be extremely dangerous especially with regard to composability/interacting with other protocols and contracts. The callback before important state changes (updates to reserve asset, collateral, and totalDebtCreated) also violates the Checks Effects Interactions best practices further widening the attack surface.
  [H-05] In the lend() function state updates are made after the callback

In TimeswapPair.sol, the `lend()` function has a callback to the msg.sender in the middle of the function while there are still updates to state that take place after the callback. The lock modifier guards against reentrancy but not against cross function reentrancy. Since the protocol implements Uniswap like functionality, this can be extremely dangerous especially with regard to composability/interacting with other protocols and contracts. The callback before important state changes (updates to totalClaims bonds, insurance and reserves assets) also violates the Checks Effects Interactions best practices further widening the attack surface.

  [M-06] TimeswapPair.sol#mint() Malicious user/attacker can mint new liquidity with an extremely small amount of yIncrease and malfunction the pair with the maturity

Submitted by WatchPug
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-timeswap/blob/bf50d2a8bb93a5571f35f96bd74af54d9c92a210/Timeswap/Timeswap-V1-Convenience/contracts/libraries/MintMath.sol#L14-L34
The current implementation of TimeswapPair.sol#mint() allows the caller to specify an arbitrary value for yIncrease.
However, since state.y is expected to be a large number based at 2**32, once the initial state.y is set to a small number (1 wei for example), the algorithm won't effectively change state.y with regular market operations (borrow, lend and mint).
  [M-09] DOS pay function

Submitted by egjlmn1
in the `pay()` function users repay their debt and in line 364: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-timeswap/blob/main/Timeswap/Timeswap-V1-Core/contracts/TimeswapPair.sol#L364 it decreases their debt.
lets say a user wants to repay all his debt, he calls the pay() function with his full debt. an attacker can see it and frontrun to repay a single token for his debt (since it's likely the token uses 18 decimals, a single token is worth almost nothing) and since your solidity version is above 0.8.0 the line: due.debt -= assetsIn[i]; will revert due to underflow
The attacker can keep doing it everytime the user is going to pay and since 1 token is baisicly 0$ (18 decimals) the attacker doesn't lose real money

**[H-01] TimeswapPair.sol#borrow() Improper implementation allows attacker to increase pool.state.z to a large value**

**Report Description**:
The `borrow()` function in `TimeswapPair.sol` allows a user to input a value for `zIncrease`, which is used to update `pool.state.z`. However, the actual collateral asset transferred in is calculated separately, and the state of `pool.state.z` is increased by the user's input value. An attacker can exploit this by using a dust amount of `xDecrease` (e.g., 1 wei) to minimize the required collateral while significantly increasing `pool.state.z`. This manipulation can lead to an imbalance in the pool's state, allowing the attacker to retrieve a large amount of collateral with minimal effort.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this specific issue. The described vulnerability involves improper state updates and manipulation of `pool.state.z`, which is not covered in the response list.

---

**[H-03] Manipulation of the Y State Results in Interest Rate Manipulation**

**Report Description**:
The `mint` function in `TimeswapPair.sol` lacks constraints on user input, allowing an attacker to arbitrarily modify the interest rate by providing minimal amounts of Asset Token and Collateral Token. This manipulation can disrupt the intended economic model of the pool, leading to unfair interest rate adjustments and potential financial losses for other users.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**[H-04] Important state updates are made after the callback in the mint() function**

**Report Description**:
The `mint()` function in `TimeswapPair.sol` includes a callback to the `msg.sender` before updating critical state variables such as reserve asset, collateral, and totalDebtCreated. This violates the Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern and increases the risk of cross-function reentrancy attacks. An attacker could exploit this to manipulate the state of the contract before the updates are completed, potentially leading to financial losses or other unintended behaviors.

**[H-05] In the lend() function state updates are made after the callback**

**Report Description**:
The `lend()` function in `TimeswapPair.sol` includes a callback to the `msg.sender` before updating critical state variables such as totalClaims, bonds, insurance, and reserve assets. This violates the Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern and increases the risk of cross-function reentrancy attacks. An attacker could exploit this to manipulate the state of the contract before the updates are completed, potentially leading to financial losses or other unintended behaviors.

**[M-06] TimeswapPair.sol#mint() Malicious user/attacker can mint new liquidity with an extremely small amount of yIncrease and malfunction the pair with the maturity**

**Report Description**:
The `mint()` function in `TimeswapPair.sol` allows a user to specify an arbitrary value for `yIncrease`. If the initial `state.y` is set to a very small value (e.g., 1 wei), the algorithm may not effectively update `state.y` with regular market operations (e.g., borrow, lend, and mint). This can lead to a malfunction in the pair, disrupting the intended economic model and potentially causing financial losses for other users.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this specific issue. The described vulnerability involves manipulation of `state.y` and its impact on the pair's functionality, which is not covered in the response list.

---

**[M-09] DOS pay function**

**Report Description**:
The `pay()` function in `TimeswapPair.sol` allows users to repay their debt. However, an attacker can frontrun a user's transaction by repaying a single token of debt, causing the user's transaction to revert due to an underflow error. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack, preventing users from repaying their debts and potentially locking their collateral.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential Denial of Service in `pay` function due to unbounded loop""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the potential for a DoS attack in the `pay` function but focuses on unbounded loops rather than the specific underflow vulnerability described in the issue. The response does not fully address the described attack vector.

",4381,569,"[H-02] TimeswapConvenience.sol#borrowGivenDebt() Attacker can increase state.y to an extremely large value with a dust amount of assetOut

Submitted by WatchPug
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-timeswap/blob/bf50d2a8bb93a5571f35f96bd74af54d9c92a210/Timeswap/Timeswap-V1-Convenience/contracts/libraries/BorrowMath.sol#L19-L53
This issue is similar to the two previous issues related to state.y manipulation. Unlike the other two issues, this function is not on TimeswapPair.sol but on TimeswapConvenience.sol, therefore this can not be solved by adding onlyConvenience modifier.
Actually, we believe that it does not make sense for the caller to specify the interest they want to pay, we recommend removing this function.

  ""ReviewingTheCode"": ""The contract `TimeswapConvenience` serves as a router or facade for interacting with the Timeswap V1 protocol. It simplifies user interactions, particularly handling ETH by automatically wrapping/unwrapping it into WETH. It delegates the core logic for various Timeswap operations (like minting liquidity, lending, borrowing, repaying) to specific libraries (`Mint`, `Burn`, `Lend`, `Borrow`, `Pay`, `Withdraw`, `DeployNative`). The contract implements required callback interfaces (`ITimeswapMintCallback`, `ITimeswapLendCallback`, `ITimeswapBorrowCallback`) to handle token transfers initiated by the Timeswap Pair contracts during these operations. It also includes a custom callback (`collateralizedDebtCallback`) likely related to repayment mechanisms involving deployed helper contracts.

**Report Description**:  
The `borrowGivenDebt()` function in `TimeswapConvenience.sol` allows an attacker to manipulate `state.y` to an extremely large value by providing a minimal amount of `assetOut`. This issue is similar to previous `state.y` manipulation vulnerabilities but occurs in a different contract (`TimeswapConvenience.sol`), making it unsolvable by adding the `onlyConvenience` modifier. The report suggests that allowing the caller to specify the interest they want to pay is inherently flawed and recommends removing the function entirely.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the specific issue of `state.y` manipulation in `borrowGivenDebt()` or the broader concern of allowing callers to specify interest rates. This is a critical oversight, as the vulnerability could lead to significant financial manipulation and exploitation. The absence of any mention of this issue in the response list indicates a gap in the security analysis.

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:  
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:  
- *None*

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:  
- **[H-02] TimeswapConvenience.sol#borrowGivenDebt() Attacker can increase state.y to an extremely large value with a dust amount of assetOut**

### **Analysis of Gaps**  
The response list fails to address the `state.y` manipulation vulnerability in `TimeswapConvenience.sol`, which is a high-severity issue. This omission highlights a significant gap in the security review, as the vulnerability could lead to severe financial consequences if exploited. Future analyses should ensure that all reported issues, especially those with high severity, are thoroughly evaluated and addressed.","```

Submitted by sirhashalot
The safeDecimals() function, found in the SafeMetadata.sol contract and called in 3 different Timeswap Convenience contracts, can cause a revert. This is because the safeDecimals function attempts to use abi.decode to return a uint8 when data.length >= 32. However, a data.length value greater than 32 will cause abi.decode to revert.

Submitted by sirhashalot
The safeName() function, found in the SafeMetadata.sol contract and called in 4 Timeswap Convenience contracts in the name() functions, can cause a revert. This could make the 4 contracts not compliant with the ERC20 standard for certain asset pairs, because the name() function should return a string and not revert.
The root cause of the issue is that the safeName() function assumes the return type of any ERC20 token to be a string. If the return value is not a string, abi.decode() will revert, and this will cause the name() functions in the Timeswap ERC20 contracts to revert. There are some tokens that aren't compliant, such as Sai from Maker, which returns a bytes32 value: https://kauri.io/#single/dai-token-guide-for-developers/#token-info
Because this is known to cause issues with tokens that don't fully follow the ERC20 spec, the safeName() function in the BoringCrypto library has a fix for this. The BoringCrypto safeName() function is similar to

  ""ExternalInteractions"": [
    ""The library interacts extensively with external contracts conforming to the `IERC20` interface."",
    ""It uses `address(token).staticcall` for read-only functions (`symbol`, `name`, `decimals`, `balanceOf`)."",
    ""It uses `address(token).call` for state-changing functions (`transfer`, `transferFrom`)."",
    ""The behavior relies on the external token contract's implementation and adherence (or lack thereof) to the ERC20 standard.""
  ],
  ""SpecialMechanisms"": [
    ""**Low-Level Calls:** Uses `staticcall` and `call` directly on the token address, bypassing potential ABI mismatches at the higher Solidity interface level."",
    ""**Function Selector Constants:** Pre-calculates and uses `bytes4` constants for function selectors, potentially saving gas."",
    ""**Safe Wrappers:** Each function wraps the external call with checks on the `success` boolean returned by `call`/`staticcall`."",
    ""**Return Data Handling:** Explicitly checks `data.length` and decodes return values (`string`, `uint8`, `uint256`, `bool`). Handles non-standard ERC20s (e.g., `transfer`/`transferFrom` not returning bool) by checking `data.length == 0`."",
    ""**Flexible String Decoding:** `returnDataToString` attempts to handle both standard ABI-encoded strings and non-standard `bytes32` strings."",

#### **[M-02] safeDecimals can revert causing DoS**

**Report Description**:  
The `safeDecimals()` function in the `SafeMetadata.sol` contract can cause a revert when `data.length >= 32`. This occurs because `abi.decode` expects a `uint8` return value, but if `data.length` is greater than 32, it will revert. This issue can lead to a denial of service (DoS) in the Timeswap Convenience contracts that rely on this function.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Missing Error Handling for Non-Standard ERC20 Implementations and Potential Incompatibility""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the general issue of incompatibility with non-standard ERC20 tokens and mentions the potential for reverts. However, it does not specifically address the `safeDecimals` function or the exact cause of the revert (i.e., `data.length >= 32`). The response also lacks a detailed explanation of the impact on the Timeswap Convenience contracts.

---

#### **[M-03] safeName() can revert causing DoS**

**Report Description**:  
The `safeName()` function in the `SafeMetadata.sol` contract can cause a revert when interacting with non-compliant ERC20 tokens (e.g., tokens that return `bytes32` instead of a string). This issue can make the Timeswap Convenience contracts non-compliant with the ERC20 standard, as the `name()` function should not revert. The root cause is the assumption that all tokens return a string, which is not always true.

#### **[M-04] safeSymbol() can revert causing DoS**

**Report Description**:  
The `safeSymbol()` function in the `SafeMetadata.sol` contract can cause a revert when interacting with non-compliant ERC20 tokens (e.g., tokens that return `bytes32` instead of a string). This issue can make the Timeswap Convenience contracts non-compliant with the ERC20 standard, as the `symbol()` function should not revert. The root cause is the assumption that all tokens return a string, which is not always true.

### **Analysis of Gaps**

While the response list covers the general theme of incompatibility with non-standard ERC20 tokens, it lacks specificity in addressing the exact functions (`safeDecimals`, `safeName`, and `safeSymbol`) and their unique vulnerabilities. The responses also do not provide detailed explanations of the impacts on the Timeswap Convenience contracts or suggest specific fixes for these issues. This indicates a need for more granular and function-specific analysis in the response list.","```
