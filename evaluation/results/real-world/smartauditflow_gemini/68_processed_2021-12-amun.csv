}",1019,135,"[H-01] Unused ERC20 tokens are not refunded, and can be stolen by attacker

Submitted by WatchPug
Under certain circumstances, e.g. annualizedFee being minted to feeBeneficiary between the time user sent the transaction and the transaction being packed into the block and causing amounts of underlying tokens for each basketToken to decrease. It’s possible or even most certainly that there will be some leftover basket underlying tokens, as BasketFacet.sol#joinPool() will only transfer required amounts of basket tokens from Join contracts.
However, in the current implementation, only the leftover inputToken is returned.
As a result, the leftover underlying tokens won’t be returned to the user, which constitutes users’ fund loss.
SingleTokenJoinV2.sol L57-L78
 Furthermore, the leftover tokens in the SingleTokenJoinV2 contract can be stolen by calling `joinTokenSingle()` with fake outputBasket contract and swap.exchange contract.   [M-01] Function joinTokenSingle in SingleTokenJoin.sol and SingleTokenJoinV2.sol can be made to fail

Submitted by pmerkleplant, also found by certora, hyh, p4st13r4, pauliax, robee, and WatchPug
Impact

There’s a griefing attack vulnerability in the function joinTokenSingle in SingleTokenJoin.sol as well as SingleTokenJoinV2.sol which makes any user transaction fail with “FAILEDOUTPUTAMOUNT”.
Proof of Concept

The JoinTokenStruct argument for joinTokenSingle includes a field outputAmount to indicate the amount of tokens the user should receive after joining a basket (see line 135 and 130).
However, this amount is compared to the contract’s balance of the token and reverts if the amount is unequal.
If an attacker sends some amount of a basket’s token to the contract, every call to this function will fail as long as the output token equals the attacker’s token send.

 [M-02] Unchecked return value from low-level call()

Submitted by JMukesh, also found by certora
Impact

The return value of the low-level call is not checked, so if the call fails, the Ether will be locked in the contract. If the low level is used to prevent blocking operations, consider logging failed calls.

#### **[H-01] Unused ERC20 tokens are not refunded, and can be stolen by attacker**

**Report Description**:  
Under certain circumstances, leftover basket underlying tokens are not returned to the user, leading to fund loss. Additionally, leftover tokens in the `SingleTokenJoinV2` contract can be stolen by calling `joinTokenSingle()` with a fake `outputBasket` contract and `swap.exchange` contract.

**Match in Response List**:  
No match found.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of leftover tokens not being refunded or the potential theft of these tokens. This is a significant oversight, as it directly impacts user funds and contract security.

---

#### **[M-01] Function `joinTokenSingle` in `SingleTokenJoin.sol` and `SingleTokenJoinV2.sol` can be made to fail**

**Report Description**:  
A griefing attack vulnerability exists in `joinTokenSingle`, where an attacker can send tokens to the contract, causing the function to fail with ""FAILEDOUTPUTAMOUNT"" due to an imbalance in the contract's token balance.

**Match in Response List**:  
No match found.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the griefing attack vulnerability in `joinTokenSingle`. This is a missed issue that could lead to denial of service for legitimate users.

---

#### **[M-02] Unchecked return value from low-level call()**

**Report Description**:  
The return value of a low-level call is not checked, which could result in Ether being locked in the contract if the call fails.

**Match in Response List**:  
No match found.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of unchecked low-level call return values. This is a critical oversight, as it could lead to funds being permanently locked in the contract.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:  
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:  
- *None*

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:  
- **[H-01] Unused ERC20 tokens are not refunded, and can be stolen by attacker**  
- **[M-01] Function `joinTokenSingle` in `SingleTokenJoin.sol` and `SingleTokenJoinV2.sol` can be made to fail**  
- **[M-02] Unchecked return value from low-level call()**

---

### **Conclusion**  
The response list does not adequately address the issues raised in the issue report. Key vulnerabilities related to fund loss, theft, griefing attacks, and unchecked low-level calls are entirely missed. This indicates a significant gap in the coverage, accuracy, and sufficiency of the responses. The response list should be revised to include these critical issues to ensure comprehensive security analysis and mitigation.","```

}",2966,393,"[H-02] It might not be possible to withdraw tokens from the basket

Submitted by Czar102, also found by csanuragjain
Impact

When enough basket token owners exit, it will be impossible to exit pool with the last `MIN_AMOUNT` tokens because of this check. This will result in locking some tokens forever.
  [M-04] Annualized fee APY dependence on the frequency of executing a function

Submitted by Czar102
Impact

The APY of the annualized fee is dependent on the frequency of the execution of the BasketFacet::chargeOutstandingAnnualizedFee(). If it is called more frequently, the compounding is more frequent and the APY is higher. For less used baskets, the APY might be lower, because the compounding will happen at lower rate.
  [M-05] totalSupply may exceed `LibBasketStorage.basketStorage().maxCap`

Submitted by Czar102, also found by gpersoon, gzeon, kenzo, and WatchPug
Impact

Total supply of the token may exceed the maxCap introduced. This can happen when a user wants to join the pool. The check in BasketFacet::joinPool(...) includes only the base amount, without fee. Thus, if fee is on and someone will want to create as many tokens as possible, the totalSupply + _amount will be set to maxCap. The call will succeed, but new tokens were also minted as the fee for bs.feeBeneficiary if bs.entryFee and bs.entryFeeBeneficiaryShare are nonzero. Thus, the number of tokens may exceed maxCap.
  [M-10] fees calculations are not accurate

Function `calcOutStandingAnnualizedFee`
after that fee is calculated, it is minted to the feeBeneficiary. simply minting the exact amount results lower fee than it should be.
Impact

feeBeneficiary will get less fees than it should.
Proof of Concept

let’s assume that the basket assets are worth 1M dollars, and totalSupply = 1M. the result of calcOutStandingAnnualizedFee is 100,00 so the feeBeneficiary should get 100,00 dollars. however, when minting 100,00 the totalSupply will increase to 1,100,000 so they will own 100000/1100000 * (1M dollars) = 90909.09 dollars instead of 100k

#### **[H-02] It might not be possible to withdraw tokens from the basket**

**Report Description**:  
When enough basket token owners exit, it will be impossible to exit the pool with the last `MIN_AMOUNT` tokens because of a check in the code. This will result in locking some tokens forever.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The issue describes a scenario where tokens can be permanently locked due to a `MIN_AMOUNT` check, but this specific vulnerability is not addressed in the `response_list`. The response list focuses on other issues like reentrancy, slippage, and integer overflows but does not cover this particular edge case.

---

#### **[M-04] Annualized fee APY dependence on the frequency of executing a function**

**Report Description**:  
The APY of the annualized fee is dependent on the frequency of the execution of `BasketFacet::chargeOutstandingAnnualizedFee()`. If it is called more frequently, the compounding is more frequent and the APY is higher. For less used baskets, the APY might be lower because the compounding will happen at a lower rate.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The issue highlights a dependency on the frequency of function execution for APY calculations, but this specific concern is not addressed in the `response_list`. The response list discusses reentrancy and fee calculations but does not cover the compounding frequency issue.

---

#### **[M-05] `totalSupply` may exceed `LibBasketStorage.basketStorage().maxCap`**

**Report Description**:  
The `totalSupply` of the token may exceed the `maxCap` introduced. This can happen when a user wants to join the pool. The check in `BasketFacet::joinPool(...)` includes only the base amount, without the fee. Thus, if the fee is on and someone wants to create as many tokens as possible, the `totalSupply + _amount` will be set to `maxCap`. The call will succeed, but new tokens are also minted as the fee for `bs.feeBeneficiary` if `bs.entryFee` and `bs.entryFeeBeneficiaryShare` are nonzero. Thus, the number of tokens may exceed `maxCap`.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Inconsistent Calculation of Total Supply in `calcTokensForAmount`""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies inconsistencies in the calculation of `totalSupply` but does not explicitly address the scenario where `totalSupply` exceeds `maxCap` due to fee minting. The core issue of exceeding `maxCap` is not fully covered.

---

#### **[M-10] Fees calculations are not accurate**

**Report Description**:  
In the function `calcOutStandingAnnualizedFee`, after the fee is calculated, it is minted to the `feeBeneficiary`. Simply minting the exact amount results in a lower fee than it should be. For example, if the basket assets are worth 1M dollars and `totalSupply = 1M`, the result of `calcOutStandingAnnualizedFee` is 100,000. However, when minting 100,000, the `totalSupply` increases to 1,100,000, so the `feeBeneficiary` will own 100,000/1,100,000 * 1M dollars = 90,909.09 dollars instead of 100,000.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential discrepancy in token amounts due to outstanding fees in `calcTokensForAmount`""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies discrepancies in token amounts due to outstanding fees but does not explicitly address the specific issue of inaccurate fee calculations caused by minting increasing `totalSupply`. The core issue of fee inaccuracy is not fully covered.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:  
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:  
- **[M-05] `totalSupply` may exceed `LibBasketStorage.basketStorage().maxCap`**  
- **[M-10] Fees calculations are not accurate**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:  
- **[H-02] It might not be possible to withdraw tokens from the basket**  
- **[M-04] Annualized fee APY dependence on the frequency of executing a function**

---

### **Conclusion**  
The `response_list` partially addresses some issues but misses critical vulnerabilities like token locking and APY dependency. It also does not fully cover the scenarios where `totalSupply` exceeds `maxCap` or where fee calculations are inaccurate. Improvements are needed to ensure comprehensive coverage of all reported issues.","```

Impact

Some functions, like rebalance() in RebalanceManagerV3 use _deadline as a time limit for swapExactTokensForTokens() Other functions, like _joinTokenSingle() of SingleTokenJoinV2.sol and _exit() of SingleNativeTokenExitV2() use block.timestamp, although a deadline field is present in the struct.
Possibly the deadline fields should have been used.

**Report Description**:
Some functions, like `rebalance()` in `RebalanceManagerV3`, use `_deadline` as a time limit for `swapExactTokensForTokens()`. Other functions, like `_joinTokenSingle()` in `SingleTokenJoinV2.sol` and `_exit()` in `SingleNativeTokenExitV2.sol`, use `block.timestamp`, although a `deadline` field is present in the struct. This inconsistency suggests that the `deadline` fields should have been used instead of `block.timestamp`. This could lead to potential issues with transaction timing and execution, especially in scenarios where precise deadlines are critical.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of inconsistent use of `block.timestamp` and `_deadline` in the contract functions. The provided responses focus on access control and input validation, which are unrelated to the timing and deadline concerns raised in the issue report. Therefore, the response list fails to cover this specific vulnerability.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:
- **[M-06] block.timestamp or deadline**

---

The response list does not adequately address the issue of inconsistent use of `block.timestamp` and `_deadline` in the contract functions. This gap highlights the need for a more comprehensive review of timing-related vulnerabilities in the smart contract code.","```

Submitted by cmichel, also found by defsec, JMukesh, p4st13r4, and WatchPug
The ERC20.transfer() and ERC20.transferFrom() functions return a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success. Some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead.
See:
SingleNativeTokenExitV2.exit’s outputToken.transfer(msg.sender, outputTokenBalance);
PieFactoryContract.bakePie’s pie.transfer(msg.sender, _initialSupply);
Impact

Tokens that don’t actually perform the transfer and return false are still counted as a correct transfer and the tokens remain in the SingleNativeTokenExitV2 contract and could potentially be stolen by someone else.
 [M-08] SingleNativeTokenExitV2 assumes first exchange holds the outputToken

Submitted by kenzo, also found by cmichel and hyh
SingleNativeTokenExitV2 allows the user to exit and execute trades via multiple exchanges. When finishing the trades and sending a single output token back to the user, the contract takes that token from the last swap in the first exchange’s trades. There is nothing in the struct that signifies this will be the output token, and this also impairs the exit functionality.

**Report Description**:
The `ERC20.transfer()` and `ERC20.transferFrom()` functions return a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success. Some tokens do not revert if the transfer fails but return `false` instead. Examples include:
- `SingleNativeTokenExitV2.exit`’s `outputToken.transfer(msg.sender, outputTokenBalance);`
- `PieFactoryContract.bakePie`’s `pie.transfer(msg.sender, _initialSupply);`

**Impact**:
Tokens that don’t actually perform the transfer and return `false` are still counted as a correct transfer, and the tokens remain in the `SingleNativeTokenExitV2` contract. This could potentially allow someone else to steal the tokens.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Lack of Error Handling for External Transfers""**.

**Validation**:
**Correct**. The response identifies the issue with unchecked external transfers, specifically mentioning that `transfer` methods are not checked for success. This aligns with the issue report, which highlights the risk of not validating return values from `ERC20.transfer()` and `ERC20.transferFrom()` calls. The response correctly emphasizes the importance of handling transfer failures, which is a Solidity best practice.

### **[M-08] SingleNativeTokenExitV2 assumes first exchange holds the outputToken**

**Report Description**:
`SingleNativeTokenExitV2` allows the user to exit and execute trades via multiple exchanges. When finishing the trades and sending a single output token back to the user, the contract takes that token from the last swap in the first exchange’s trades. There is nothing in the struct that signifies this will be the output token, and this also impairs the exit functionality.

**Impact**:
The assumption that the first exchange holds the output token is not enforced, which could lead to incorrect token transfers and impair the exit functionality.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The assumption about the first exchange holding the output token is a critical flaw that is not covered in any of the responses. This omission represents a gap in the response list’s coverage of the reported issues.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:
- **[M-07] ERC20 return values not checked**

**Partially Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:
- **[M-08] SingleNativeTokenExitV2 assumes first exchange holds the outputToken**

---

The response list effectively addresses the issue of unchecked ERC20 return values but fails to cover the assumption about the first exchange holding the output token. This gap highlights the need for a more comprehensive review of the contract’s logic and assumptions.","```

",869,128,"[M-09] Failed transfer with low level call could be overlooked

Submitted by harleythedog
Impact

The CallFacet.sol contract has the function _call :
function \_call(
 address \_target,
 bytes memory \_calldata,
 uint256 \_value
) internal {
 require(address(this).balance >= \_value, ""ETH\_BALANCE\_TOO\_LOW"");
 (bool success, ) = \_target.call{value: \_value}(\_calldata);
 require(success, ""CALL\_FAILED"");
 emit Call(msg.sender, \_target, \_calldata, \_value);
}

This function is utilized in a lot of different places. According to the Solidity docs, “The low-level functions call, delegatecall and staticcall return true as their first return value if the account called is non-existent, as part of the design of the EVM. Account existence must be checked prior to calling if needed”.
As a result, it is possible that this call will not work but _call will not notice anything went wrong. It could be possible that a user is interacting with an exchange or token that has been deleted, but _call will not notice that something has gone wrong and as a result, ether can become stuck in the contract. For this reason, it would be better to also check for the contract’s existence prior to executing _target.call.

}",187.75733876228333,3548.0,32.0,"### **[M-09] Failed transfer with low level call could be overlooked**

**Report Description**:
The `_call` function in `CallFacet.sol` uses a low-level `call` to transfer Ether to a target address. According to the Solidity documentation, low-level calls like `call` return `true` as their first return value if the target account is non-existent. This means that the function could fail silently if the target contract has been deleted or does not exist, potentially leaving Ether stuck in the contract. The issue suggests that the contract should check for the existence of the target contract before executing the call to prevent this scenario.

**Match in Response List**:
No match found.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. None of the responses in the `response_list` address the specific issue of low-level `call` returning `true` for non-existent contracts. While several responses discuss reentrancy risks and gas-related issues with the `_call` function, none of them mention the potential for silent failures due to non-existent contracts. This is a critical oversight, as the issue highlights a significant risk that could lead to Ether being stuck in the contract.

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:
- **[M-09] Failed transfer with low level call could be overlooked**

---

### **Conclusion**
The `response_list` does not adequately address the issue of low-level `call` returning `true` for non-existent contracts, which is a significant vulnerability. This gap in coverage highlights the need for a more thorough review of the `_call` function to ensure all potential risks are identified and mitigated.","```
