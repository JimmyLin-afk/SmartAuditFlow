",4847,684,"[H-01] Controller.setCap sets wrong vault balance

Submitted by cmichel
The `Controller.setCap` function sets a cap for a strategy and withdraws any excess amounts (_diff). The vault balance is decreased by the entire strategy balance instead of by this _diff: ```
// @audit why not sub _diff?
_vaultDetails[_vault].balance = _vaultDetails[_vault].balance.sub(_balance);
```  [H-02] set cap breaks vault's Balance

In controller.sol's function setCap, the contract wrongly handles _vaultDetails[_vault].balance. While the balance should be decreased by the difference of strategies balance, it subtracts the remaining balance of the strategy. See Controller.sol L262-L278. `_vaultDetails[_vault].balance = _vaultDetails[_vault].balance.sub(_balance);`
This would result in vaultDetails[_vault].balance being far smaller than the strategy's value. A user would trigger the assertion at Controller.sol#475 and the fund would be locked in the strategy.
Though setCap is a permission function that only the operator can call, it's likely to be called and the fund would be locked in the contract. I consider this a high severity issue.
  [H-04] Controller does not raise an error when there's insufficient liquidity

MEV, TOD attack

When a user tries to withdraw the token from the vault, the vault would withdraw the token from the controller if there's insufficient liquidity in the vault. However, the controller does not raise an error when there's insufficient liquidity in the controller/ strategies. The user would lose his shares while getting nothing.
An MEV searcher could apply this attack on any withdrawal. When an attacker found an unconfirmed tx that tries to withdraw 1M dai, he can do such sandwich attack.
Deposits USDC into the vault.
Withdraw all dai left in the vault/controller/strategy.
Place the vitims tx here. The victim would get zero dai while burning 1 M share. This would pump the share price.
Withdraw all liquidity.
All users would be vulnerable to MEV attackers. I consider this is a high-risk issue.  [H-09] `removeToken` would break the vault/protocol.

There's no safety check in Manager.sol's removeToken. `Manager.sol#L454-L487`
The token would be locked in the original vault. Given the current design, the vault would keep a ratio of total amount to save the gas. Once the token is removed at manager contract, these token would lost.
Controller's balanceOf would no longer reflects the real value. Controller.sol#L488-L495 While _vaultDetails[msg.sender].balance; remains the same, user can nolonger withdraw those amount.
Share price in the vault would decrease drastically. The share price is calculated as totalValue / totalSupply Vault.sol#L217. While the totalSupply of the share remains the same, the total balance has drastically decreased.
Calling removeToken way would almost break the whole protocol if the vault has already started. I consider this is a high-risk issue.

[M-08] Controller.inCaseStrategyGetStuck does not update balance

The `Controller.inCaseStrategyGetStuck` withdraws from a strategy but does not call updateBalance(_vault, _strategy) afterwards.

The _vaultDetails[_vault].balances[_strategy] variable does not correctly track the actual strategy balance anymore. I'm not sure what exactly this field is used for besides getting the withdraw amounts per strategy in getBestStrategyWithdraw. As the strategy contains a lower amount than stored in the field, Controller.withdraw will attempt to withdraw too much.

### **[H-01] Controller.setCap sets wrong vault balance**

**Report Description**:  
The `Controller.setCap` function sets a cap for a strategy and withdraws any excess amounts (`_diff`). However, the vault balance is decreased by the entire strategy balance instead of by the `_diff`. This results in the vault balance being far smaller than the strategy's value, potentially locking funds in the strategy and causing the fund to be locked in the contract. This is a high-severity issue.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Incorrect Balance Update Logic in `withdraw`, `setCap`, and `withdrawAll`""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue with incorrect balance updates in the `setCap` function. It correctly explains the risks associated with reducing the vault balance by the entire strategy balance instead of the `_diff`, which aligns with the reported issue.

---

### **[H-02] set cap breaks vault's Balance**

**Report Description**:  
The `setCap` function in `Controller.sol` incorrectly handles `_vaultDetails[_vault].balance`. Instead of decreasing the balance by the difference of the strategy's balance, it subtracts the remaining balance of the strategy. This would result in the vault balance being far smaller than the strategy's value, potentially locking funds in the strategy. This is a high-severity issue.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Incorrect Balance Update Logic in `withdraw`, `setCap`, and `withdrawAll`""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue with incorrect balance updates in the `setCap` function. It correctly explains the risks associated with reducing the vault balance by the entire strategy balance instead of the `_diff`, which aligns with the reported issue.

---

### **[H-04] Controller does not raise an error when there's insufficient liquidity**

**Report Description**:  
When a user tries to withdraw tokens from the vault, the vault withdraws tokens from the controller if there's insufficient liquidity in the vault. However, the controller does not raise an error when there's insufficient liquidity in the controller/strategies. This could lead to users losing their shares while getting nothing. An MEV searcher could exploit this vulnerability through a sandwich attack, causing significant financial loss to users. This is a high-severity issue.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of insufficient liquidity checks in the controller, nor does it mention the potential for MEV attacks or sandwich attacks. This is a significant gap in the response list.

---

### **[H-09] `removeToken` would break the vault/protocol**

**Report Description**:  
The `removeToken` function in `Manager.sol` lacks safety checks. Removing a token would lock it in the original vault, and the vault's balance would no longer reflect the real value. This would drastically decrease the share price in the vault, as the share price is calculated as `totalValue / totalSupply`. Calling `removeToken` could break the entire protocol if the vault has already started. This is a high-severity issue.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of `removeToken` lacking safety checks or the potential for breaking the vault/protocol. This is a significant gap in the response list.

---

### **[M-08] Controller.inCaseStrategyGetStuck does not update balance**

**Report Description**:  
The `Controller.inCaseStrategyGetStuck` function withdraws from a strategy but does not call `updateBalance(_vault, _strategy)` afterward. This results in `_vaultDetails[_vault].balances[_strategy]` not correctly tracking the actual strategy balance. This could lead to incorrect withdrawal amounts in `Controller.withdraw`, as the function will attempt to withdraw too much.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Unbounded `SafeERC20.safeTransfer` Usage Leading to Potential Issues""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the issue with `inCaseStrategyGetStuck` but focuses on the use of `SafeERC20.safeTransfer` without checking the actual amount transferred. It does not address the core issue of failing to update the balance after withdrawing from the strategy, which is the primary concern in the reported issue.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:

- **[H-01] Controller.setCap sets wrong vault balance**
- **[H-02] set cap breaks vault's Balance**

**Partially Correct Matches**:

- **[M-08] Controller.inCaseStrategyGetStuck does not update balance**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:

- **[H-04] Controller does not raise an error when there's insufficient liquidity**
- **[H-09] `removeToken` would break the vault/protocol**

--- 

The response list covers some issues accurately, particularly those related to incorrect balance updates in `setCap`. However, it misses critical issues such as insufficient liquidity checks, MEV attacks, and the risks associated with `removeToken`. Additionally, the response to `inCaseStrategyGetStuck` is partially correct but does not fully address the reported issue.","```
1. Incorrect Balance Update Logic in `withdraw`, `setCap`, and `withdrawAll`
```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the rank of the true positive**:
   - The true positive is ""Incorrect Balance Update Logic in `withdraw`, `setCap`, and `withdrawAll`"".
   - This issue appears at **rank 3** in the ranked list of predictions.

2. **Calculate the precision at rank 3 (P@3)**:
   - Precision at rank 3 is the number of true positives up to rank 3 divided by 3.
   - Since there is only one true positive up to rank 3, \( P@3 = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333 \).

3. **Compute the Average Precision (AP)**:
   - Since there is only one true positive, the AP is simply the precision at its rank.
   - \( AP = 0.333 \).

Impact

The v3 vault treats all valid tokens exactly the same. Depositing 1M DAI would get the same share as depositing 1M USDT. User can withdraw their share in another token. Though there's withdrawalProtectionFee (0.1 percent), the vault is still a no slippage stable coin exchange.
Also, I notice that 3crv_token is added to the vault in the test. Treating 3crv_token and all other stable coins the same would make the vault vulnerable to flashloan attack. 3crv_token is an lp token and at the point of writing, the price of it is 1.01. The arbitrage space is about 0.8 percent and makes the vault vulnerable to flashloan attacks.
Though the team may not add crv_token and dai to the same vault, its design makes the vault vulnerable. Strategies need to be designed with super caution or the vault would be vulnerable to attackers.
Given the possibility of a flashloan attack, I consider this a high-risk issue.
  [H-06] earn results in decreasing share price

Impact

For a dai vault that pairs with NativeStrategyCurve3Crv, every time earn() is called, shareholders would lose money. (about 2%)
There are two issues involved. The Vault contract and the controller contract doesn't handle the price difference between the want token and other tokens.
At Vault.sol L293, when a vault calculates its value, it sums up all tokens balance. However, when the controller calculates vaults' value (at Controller.sol L410-L436), it only adds the amount of strategy.want it received. (in this case, it's t3crv).
Under the current design, users who deposit dai to the vault would not get yield. Instead, they would keep losing money. I consider this a high-risk issue
 [H-07] Vault.balance() mixes normalized and standard amounts
Loops
Submitted by cmichel
The Vault.balance function uses the balanceOfThis function which scales (""normalizes"") all balances to 18 decimals.
for (uint8 i; i < _tokens.length; i++) {
    address _token = _tokens[i];
    // everything is padded to 18 decimals
    _balance = _balance.add(_normalizeDecimals(_token, IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this))));
}

Note that balance()'s second term IController(manager.controllers(address(this))).balanceOf() is not normalized. The code is adding a non-normalized amount (for example 6 decimals only for USDC) to a normalized (18 decimals).
 [H-08] Vault.withdraw mixes normalized and standard amounts
 The `Vault.balance` function uses the balanceOfThis function which scales (""normalizes"") all balances to 18 decimals.
for (uint8 i; i < _tokens.length; i++) {
    address _token = _tokens[i];
    // everything is padded to 18 decimals
    _balance = _balance.add(_normalizeDecimals(_token, IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this))));
}

Note that balance()'s second term IController(manager.controllers(address(this))).balanceOf() is not normalized, but it must be.
This leads to many issues through the contracts that use balance but don't treat these values as normalized values. For example, in Vault.withdraw, the computed _amount value is normalized (in 18 decimals). But the uint256 _balance = IERC20(_output).balanceOf(address(this)); value is not normalized but compared to the normalized _amount and even subtracted:
// @audit compares unnormalzied output to normalized output
if (_balance < _amount) {
    IController _controller = IController(manager.controllers(address(this)));
    // @audit cannot directly subtract unnormalized
    uint256 _toWithdraw = _amount.sub(_balance);
    if (_controller.strategies() > 0) {
        _controller.withdraw(_output, _toWithdraw);
    }
    uint256 _after = IERC20(_output).balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 _diff = _after.sub(_balance);
    if (_diff < _toWithdraw) {
        _amount = _balance.add(_diff);
    }
}
 [M-03] Vault.withdraw sometimes burns too many shares

The Vault.withdraw function attempts to withdraw funds from the controller if there are not enough in the vault already. In the case the controller could not withdraw enough, i.e., where _diff < _toWithdraw, the user will receive less output tokens than their fair share would entitle them to (the initial _amount).
if (_diff < _toWithdraw) {
    // @audit burns too many shares for a below fair-share amount
    _amount = _balance.add(_diff);
}

Impact

The withdrawer receives fewer output tokens than they were entitled to.

**Report Description**:  
The v3 vault treats all valid tokens equally, allowing users to deposit one token and withdraw another without considering price differences. This creates arbitrage opportunities, especially when dealing with LP tokens like 3crv_token, which have a price of 1.01 at the time of writing. The 0.8% arbitrage space makes the vault vulnerable to flashloan attacks. Although the team may not add crv_token and dai to the same vault, the design itself is flawed and requires careful strategy design to mitigate risks. This is considered a high-risk issue due to the potential for flashloan attacks.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of token equality and arbitrage opportunities in the vault. The described vulnerabilities and risks are not covered in the response list, making this a missed issue.

---

### **[H-06] earn results in decreasing share price**

**Report Description**:  
For a dai vault paired with `NativeStrategyCurve3Crv`, calling `earn()` results in shareholders losing approximately 2% of their value. This occurs because the `Vault` contract and the `controller` contract do not handle the price difference between the want token and other tokens. The `Vault` sums up all token balances, while the `controller` only adds the amount of `strategy.want` it receives. This discrepancy causes users who deposit dai to lose money instead of earning yield, making this a high-risk issue.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of decreasing share price due to mismatched calculations between the `Vault` and `controller` contracts. This is a missed issue.

---

### **[H-07] Vault.balance() mixes normalized and standard amounts**

**Report Description**:  
The `Vault.balance` function uses the `balanceOfThis` function, which normalizes all balances to 18 decimals. However, the second term in `balance()`, `IController(manager.controllers(address(this))).balanceOf()`, is not normalized. This leads to incorrect calculations when adding normalized and non-normalized amounts, causing issues throughout the contract.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of mixing normalized and non-normalized amounts in the `Vault.balance` function. This is a missed issue.

---

### **[H-08] Vault.withdraw mixes normalized and standard amounts**

**Report Description**:  
The `Vault.withdraw` function compares and subtracts normalized and non-normalized amounts, leading to incorrect calculations. For example, the `_amount` value is normalized, but the `_balance` value is not, causing discrepancies in the withdrawal logic. This can result in users receiving fewer tokens than they are entitled to.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of mixing normalized and non-normalized amounts in the `Vault.withdraw` function. This is a missed issue.

### **[M-03] Vault.withdraw sometimes burns too many shares**

**Report Description**:  
The `Vault.withdraw` function burns shares based on the initial `_amount`, even if the controller cannot withdraw enough tokens. This results in users receiving fewer output tokens than they are entitled to, as the function burns too many shares for a below fair-share amount.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of burning too many shares in the `Vault.withdraw` function. This is a missed issue.

",997,106,"[M-01] VaultHelper deposits don't work with fee-on transfer tokens

Submitted by cmichel, also found by 0xsanson
There are ERC20 tokens that may make certain customizations to their ERC20 contracts. One type of these tokens is deflationary tokens that charge a certain fee for every transfer() or transferFrom(). Others are rebasing tokens that increase in value over time like Aave's aTokens (balanceOf changes over time).
Impact

The VaultHelper's depositVault() and depositMultipleVault functions transfer _amount to this contract using IERC20(_token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);. This could have a fee, and less than _amount ends up in the contract. The next actual vault deposit using IVault(_vault).deposit(_token, _amount); will then try to transfer more than the this contract actually has and will revert the transaction.

This is a significant logical flaw as the purpose of depositing into a gauge is typically to stake or lock the tokens (representing vault shares) within the gauge contract for rewards.

**Report Description**:  
The `VaultHelper` contract's `depositVault()` and `depositMultipleVault` functions transfer `_amount` of tokens to the contract using `IERC20(_token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);`. However, some ERC20 tokens, such as fee-on-transfer tokens or rebasing tokens, may deduct a fee or change the balance during the transfer. As a result, less than `_amount` may end up in the contract. When the contract subsequently deposits `_amount` into the vault using `IVault(_vault).deposit(_token, _amount);`, it may attempt to transfer more tokens than it actually holds, causing the transaction to revert. This issue prevents the contract from functioning correctly with fee-on-transfer or rebasing tokens.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of fee-on-transfer tokens or rebasing tokens in the `VaultHelper` contract. None of the findings in the response list mention the specific problem of token balances being reduced due to fees or rebasing mechanisms, nor do they propose a solution to handle such tokens. This is a significant oversight, as the issue directly impacts the functionality of the contract with certain ERC20 tokens.

",3492,583,"[M-02] ERC20 return values not checked

Submitted by cmichel, also found by defsec and jonah1005
The ERC20.transfer() and ERC20.transferFrom() functions return a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success. Some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead.
The `Manager.recoverToken` function does not check the return value of this function.
Impact

Tokens that don't actually perform the transfer and return false are still counted as a correct transfer. Furthermore, tokens that do not correctly implement the EIP20 standard, like USDT which does not return a success boolean, will revert.
 [M-09] token -> vault mapping can be overwritten

One vault can have many tokens, but each token should only be assigned to a single vault. The Manager contract keeps a mapping of tokens to vaults in the vaults[_token] => _vault map, and a mapping of vault to tokens in tokens[vault] => token[]. 
The `addToken` function can assign any token to a single vault and allows overwriting an existing vaults[_token] map entry with a different vault. This indirectly disassociates the previous vault for the token. Note that the previous vault's tokens[_previousVault] map still contains the token.
 [M-13] manager.allowedVaults check missing for add/remove strategy

Submitted by 0xRajeev
Impact

The manager.allowedVaults check is missing for add/remove strategy like how it is used in reorderStrategies(). This will allow a strategist to accidentally/maliciously add/remove strategies on unauthorized vaults.
Given the critical access control that is missing on vaults here, this is classified as medium severity.

}",231.5670957565308,13550.0,29.0,"### **[M-02] ERC20 return values not checked**

**Report Description**:
The `ERC20.transfer()` and `ERC20.transferFrom()` functions return a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success. Some tokens do not revert if the transfer fails but return `false` instead. The `Manager.recoverToken` function does not check the return value of these functions. Tokens that don't actually perform the transfer and return `false` are still counted as a correct transfer. Furthermore, tokens that do not correctly implement the EIP20 standard, like USDT which does not return a success boolean, will revert.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Issues with `recoverToken` Function""**.

**Validation**:
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue with the `recoverToken` function, specifically mentioning the lack of checks on the return value of ERC20 token transfers. It also highlights the risk of reentrancy, which is a related concern. This aligns with the issue described in the report.

### **[M-09] token -> vault mapping can be overwritten**

**Report Description**:
One vault can have many tokens, but each token should only be assigned to a single vault. The `Manager` contract keeps a mapping of tokens to vaults in the `vaults[_token] => _vault` map, and a mapping of vault to tokens in `tokens[vault] => token[]`. The `addToken` function can assign any token to a single vault and allows overwriting an existing `vaults[_token]` map entry with a different vault. This indirectly disassociates the previous vault for the token. Note that the previous vault's `tokens[_previousVault]` map still contains the token.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of token-to-vault mapping being overwritten in the `addToken` function. This is a missed issue in the response list.

### **[M-13] manager.allowedVaults check missing for add/remove strategy**

**Report Description**:
The `manager.allowedVaults` check is missing for add/remove strategy like how it is used in `reorderStrategies()`. This will allow a strategist to accidentally/maliciously add/remove strategies on unauthorized vaults. Given the critical access control that is missing on vaults here, this is classified as medium severity.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the missing `allowedVaults` check for the add/remove strategy functions. This is a missed issue in the response list.

1. Issues with `recoverToken` Function
```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the rank of the true positive**:
   - The true positive is ""Issues with `recoverToken` Function"".
   - In the ranked list of predictions, this issue appears at **rank 2**.

2. **Calculate the precision at rank 2 (P@2)**:
   - Precision at rank 2 is the number of true positives up to rank 2 divided by 2.
   - Since there is only one true positive up to rank 2, \( P@2 = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

3. **Compute the Average Precision (AP)**:
   - Since there is only one true positive, the AP is simply the precision at its rank.
   - Therefore, \( AP = 0.5 \).
