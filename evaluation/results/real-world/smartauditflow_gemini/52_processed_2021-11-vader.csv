}",2900,449,"[H-01] Minting and burning synths exposes users to unlimited slippage
 function `mintSynth()`
The amount of synths minted / assets received when minting or burning synths can be manipulated to an unlimited extent by manipulating the reserves of the pool
 Proof of Concept

See VaderPool.mintSynth: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-vader/blob/607d2b9e253d59c782e921bfc2951184d3f65825/contracts/dex-v2/pool/VaderPoolV2.sol#L126-L167
Here a user sends nativeDeposit to the pool and the equivalent amount of foreignAsset is minted as a synth to be sent to the user. However the user can't specify the minimum amount of synth that they would accept. A frontrunner can then manipulate the reserves of the pool in order to make foreignAsset appear more valuable than it really is so the user receives synths which are worth much less than what nativeDeposit is worth. This is equivalent to a swap without a slippage limit.
Burning synths essentially runs the same process in behalf so manipulating the pool in the opposite direction will result in the user getting fewer of nativeAsset than they expect.
  [H-02] Redemption value of synths can be manipulated to drain VaderPool of all native assets
 function `mintSynth()`
Draining of funds from VaderPool
 See the VaderPool.mintSynth function: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-vader/blob/607d2b9e253d59c782e921bfc2951184d3f65825/contracts/dex-v2/pool/VaderPoolV2.sol#L126-L167
As the pool's reserves can be manipulated through flashloans similar to on UniswapV2, an attacker may set the exchange rate between nativeAsset and synths (calculated from the reserves). An attacker can exploit this to drain funds from the pool.
The attacker first flashloans and sells a huge amount of foreignAsset to the pool. The pool now thinks nativeAsset is extremely valuable.
The attacker now uses a relatively small amount of nativeAsset to mint synths using VaderPool.mintSynth. As the pool thinks nativeAsset is very valuable the attacker will receive a huge amount of synths.
The attacker can now manipulate the pool in the opposite direction by buying up the foreignAsset they sold to the pool. nativeAsset is now back at its normal price, or perhaps artificially low if the attacker wishes.
The attacker now burns all of their synths. As nativeAsset is considered much less valuable than at the point the synths were minted it takes a lot more of nativeAsset in order to pay out for the burned synths.
For the price of a flashloan and some swap fees, the attacker has now managed to extract a large amount of nativeAsset from the pool. This process can be repeated as long as it is profitable.
 
[H-05] LPs of VaderPoolV2 can manipulate pool reserves to extract funds from the reserve.

Impermanent loss protection can be exploited to drain the reserve.

These losses are then refunded to the LP in VADER tokens from the reserve. NOTE: This IL protection is paid for ALL token pairs. THIS IS IMPORTANT!
 [H-07] VaderReserve does not support paying IL protection out to more than one address, resulting in locked funds

Submitted by TomFrenchBlockchain
Impact

All liquidity deployed to one of VaderPool or VaderPoolV2 will be locked permanently.
Proof of Concept

Both VaderRouter and VaderRouterV2 make calls to VaderReserve in order to pay out IL protection.
 [H-13] Anyone Can Arbitrarily Mint Synthetic Assets In VaderPoolV2.mintSynth()


The mintSynth() function is callable by any user and creates a synthetic asset against foreignAsset if it does not already exist. The protocol expects a user to first approve the contract as a spender before calling mintSynth(). However, any arbitrary user could monitor the blockchain for contract approvals that match VaderPoolV2.sol and effectively frontrun their call to mintSynth() by setting the to argument to their own address. As a result, the nativeDeposit amount is transferred from the victim, and a synthetic asset is minted and finally transferred to the malicious user who is represented by the to address.
 [H-14] Anyone Can Arbitrarily Mint Fungible Tokens In VaderPoolV2.mintFungible()


The mintFungible() function is callable by any user that wishes to mint liquidity pool fungible tokens. The protocol expects a user to first approve the contract as a spender before calling mintFungible(). However, any arbitrary user could monitor the blockchain for contract approvals that match VaderPoolV2.sol and effectively frontrun their call to mintFungible() by setting the to argument to their own address. As a result, the nativeDeposit and foreignDeposit amounts are transferred from the victim, and LP tokens are minted and finally transferred to the malicious user who is represented by the to address.
  [H-21] Lack of access control allow attacker to mintFungible() and mintSynth() with other user's wallet balance
 [H-22] mintSynth() and burnSynth() can be front run
  [H-29] VaderPoolV2.mintFungible exposes users to unlimited slippage

Frontrunners can extract up to 100% of the value provided by LPs to VaderPoolV2.
Proof of Concept

Users can provide liquidity to VaderPoolV2 through the mintFungible function.
https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-vader/blob/429970427b4dc65e37808d7116b9de27e395ce0c/contracts/dex-v2/pool/VaderPoolV2.sol#L271-L335
This allows users to provide tokens in any ratio and the pool will calculate what fraction of the value in the pool this makes up and mint the corresponding amount of liquidity units as an ERC20.
However there's no way for users to specify the minimum number of liquidity units they will accept. As the number of liquidity units minted is calculated from the current reserves, this allows frontrunners to manipulate the pool's reserves in such a way that the LP receives fewer liquidity units than they should. e.g. LP provides a lot of nativeAsset but very little foreignAsset, the frontrunner can then sell a lot of nativeAsset to the pool to devalue it.

---

#### **[H-01] Minting and burning synths exposes users to unlimited slippage**

**Report Description**:  
The `mintSynth()` function in `VaderPoolV2.sol` allows users to mint synths without specifying a minimum amount they will accept. This exposes users to unlimited slippage, as frontrunners can manipulate the pool's reserves to devalue the synths minted. Similarly, burning synths can result in users receiving fewer native assets than expected due to reserve manipulation.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Lack of slippage control in `mintSynth` and `burnSynth`""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the lack of slippage control in `mintSynth` and `burnSynth`, which aligns with the issue's description of unlimited slippage exposure. The response also highlights the risk of front-running and price manipulation, which are core aspects of the reported issue.

---

#### **[H-02] Redemption value of synths can be manipulated to drain `VaderPool` of all native assets**

**Report Description**:  
An attacker can manipulate the pool's reserves through flashloans to drain funds from `VaderPool`. By artificially inflating the value of `nativeAsset`, the attacker can mint a large amount of synths and then burn them after manipulating the reserves in the opposite direction, extracting a significant amount of `nativeAsset` from the pool.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the specific issue of reserve manipulation through flashloans to drain the pool. While some responses mention front-running and slippage, they do not cover the detailed attack vector described in this issue.

---

#### **[H-05] LPs of `VaderPoolV2` can manipulate pool reserves to extract funds from the reserve**

**Report Description**:  
Liquidity providers (LPs) can exploit impermanent loss protection to drain the reserve. The `burn` function calculates losses based on the current reserves, which can be manipulated by LPs to extract more funds than they are entitled to.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of LPs manipulating reserves to exploit impermanent loss protection. This is a critical gap in the response coverage.

---

#### **[H-06] Paying IL protection for all `VaderPool` pairs allows the reserve to be drained**

**Report Description**:  
The impermanent loss (IL) protection mechanism in `VaderPoolV2` pays out losses for all token pairs, which can be exploited to drain the reserve. This is particularly problematic because the reserve does not have sufficient safeguards to prevent such exploitation.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of IL protection being exploited across all token pairs to drain the reserve. This is a significant oversight.

---

#### **[H-07] `VaderReserve` does not support paying IL protection out to more than one address, resulting in locked funds**

**Report Description**:  
The `VaderReserve` contract does not support paying impermanent loss protection to multiple addresses, leading to permanently locked funds for liquidity deployed to `VaderPool` or `VaderPoolV2`.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of locked funds due to the inability of `VaderReserve` to pay IL protection to multiple addresses.

---

#### **[H-13] Anyone Can Arbitrarily Mint Synthetic Assets In `VaderPoolV2.mintSynth()`**

**Report Description**:  
The `mintSynth()` function is callable by any user and does not enforce access control. A malicious user can frontrun a victim's transaction by setting the `to` address to their own, resulting in the victim's `nativeDeposit` being transferred and the synthetic asset being minted to the attacker.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of arbitrary minting of synthetic assets due to lack of access control in `mintSynth()`.

---

#### **[H-14] Anyone Can Arbitrarily Mint Fungible Tokens In `VaderPoolV2.mintFungible()`**

**Report Description**:  
The `mintFungible()` function is callable by any user and does not enforce access control. A malicious user can frontrun a victim's transaction by setting the `to` address to their own, resulting in the victim's `nativeDeposit` and `foreignDeposit` being transferred and the LP tokens being minted to the attacker.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of arbitrary minting of fungible tokens due to lack of access control in `mintFungible()`.

---

#### **[H-21] Lack of access control allow attacker to `mintFungible()` and `mintSynth()` with other user's wallet balance**

**Report Description**:  
The lack of access control in `mintFungible()` and `mintSynth()` allows an attacker to use another user's wallet balance to mint tokens, effectively stealing their funds.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of lack of access control in `mintFungible()` and `mintSynth()`.

---

#### **[H-22] `mintSynth()` and `burnSynth()` can be front run**

**Report Description**:  
The `mintSynth()` and `burnSynth()` functions are susceptible to front-running attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the pool's reserves to their advantage before the victim's transaction is executed.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential Front Running Issues in `mintFungible`""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response mentions front-running in `mintFungible` but does not explicitly address front-running in `mintSynth()` and `burnSynth()`. While the issue is related, the response does not fully cover the reported vulnerability.

---

#### **[H-29] `VaderPoolV2.mintFungible` exposes users to unlimited slippage**

**Report Description**:  
The `mintFungible()` function does not allow users to specify a minimum amount of liquidity units they will accept, exposing them to unlimited slippage. Frontrunners can manipulate the pool's reserves to devalue the liquidity units minted.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential Front Running Issues in `mintFungible`""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the front-running risk in `mintFungible`, which aligns with the issue's description of unlimited slippage exposure.

---

On L156 of TwapOracle we perform the calculation: ```
result = ((sumUSD * IERC20Metadata(token).decimals()) / sumNative);
```
This seems extremely odd as for an 18 decimal token we're then calculating
result = ((sumUSD * 18) / sumNative);

This is just plain weird. I expect what was meant is to replace this line with the below so we're properly scaling for token's number of decimals.
uint256 scalingFactor = 10 ** IERC20Metadata(token).decimals()
result = (sumUSD * scalingFactor) / sumNative;

Marked as high severity as this exchange rate appears to be used in some form of minting mechanism and correctness of the oracle is listed as one of the key focuses of the audit.

 [H-17] TWAPOracle might register with wrong token order

Submitted by cmichel
The TWAPOracle.registerPair function takes in a factory and (token0, token1). The function accepts a _factory argument which means any Uniswap-like factory can be used.
When using the actual Uniswap factory's IUniswapV2Factory(factory).getPair(token0, token1) call, it could be that the token0 and token1 are reversed as it ignores the order.
Meaning, the price0/1CumulativeLast could also be reversed as it matches the internal order. The code however pushes the _pairs assuming that the internal price0CumulativeLast, price1CumulativeLast order matches the order of the function arguments token0, token1.
  [H-28] Incorrect Price Consultation Results

Submitted by leastwood
Impact

The TwapOracle.consult() function iterates over all token pairs which belong to either VADER or USDV` and then calculates the price of the respective asset by using both UniswapV2 and Chainlink price data. This helps to further protect against price manipulation attacks as the price is averaged out over the various registered token pairs.
Let's say we wanted to query the price of USDV, we would sum up any token pair where USDV == pairData.token0.
The sum consists of the following:
Price of USDV denominated in terms of token1 (USDV/token1).
Price of token1 denominated in terms of USD (token1/USD).
  [H-30] Newly Registered Assets Skew Consultation Results

Submitted by leastwood
Impact

The TwapOracle.consult() function iterates over all token pairs which belong to either VADER or USDV` and then calculates the price of the respective asset by using both UniswapV2 and Chainlink price data. This helps to further protect against price manipulation attacks as the price is averaged out over the various registered token pairs.
If a new asset is added by first registering the token pair and aggregator, the consultation result for that token pair will remain skewed until the next update interval. This is due to the fact that the native asset amount will return 0 due to the default price1Average value being used. However, the Chainlink oracle will return a valid result. As a result, the query will be skewed in favour of sumUSD resulting in incorrect consultations.
I'd classify this issue as high risk as the oracle returns false results upon being consulted. This can lead to issues in other areas of the protocol that use this data in performing sensitive actions
  [M-01] Unbounded loop in TwapOracle.update can result in oracle being locked

Function `TwapOracle.update`

Loss of ability of TwapOracle to update should too many pools be added.
Proof of Concept

TwapOracle allows an unlimited number of pairs to be added and has no way of removing pairs after the fact. At the same time `TwapOracle.update` iterates through all pairs in order to update value for each pair.
https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-vader/blob/3a43059e33d549f03b021d6b417b7eeba66cf62e/contracts/twap/TwapOracle.sol#L322-L369
TwapOracle.registerPair is a permissioned function so that only the owner can add new pairs however should the owner account be compromised or not mindful of the number of pairs being added it is possible to put the oracle into a state in which it is unable to update. The oracle cannot recover from this state
  [M-03] Permissioned nature of TwapOracle allows owner to manipulate oracle

Function `update`

https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-vader/blob/3a43059e33d549f03b021d6b417b7eeba66cf62e/contracts/twap/TwapOracle.sol#L322
Only the owner of TwapOracle can call update on the oracle. Should the owner desire they could cease calling update on the oracle for a period. Over this period the relative prices of VADER and USDC will vary.
After some period timeElapsed the owner can call update again. A TWAP is a lagging indicator and due to the owner ceasing to update the oracle so timeElapsed will be very large, therefore we're averaging over a long period into the past resulting in a value which may not be representative of the current USDV:VADER exchange rate.
  [M-18] TWAPOracle.getRate does not scale the ratio

Submitted by cmichel
The TWAPOracle.getRate function simply performs an integer division to compute the rate.
function getRate() public view returns (uint256 result) {
    uint256 tUSDInUSDV = consult(USDV);
    uint256 tUSDInVader = consult(VADER);
    // @audit shouldn't this scale by 1e18 first? otherwise easily 0
    result = tUSDInUSDV / tUSDInVader;
}
  [M-19] Unclear TwapOracle.consult algorithm

Submitted by cmichel
The TWAPOracle.consult function is unclear to the auditor. It seems to iterate through all registered pairs that share the token parameter (USDV or VADER) and then sums up the foreign token pair per token price. And divides this sum (sumNative) by the summed-up USD price of these foreign token pairs (sumUSD).
I think the idea is to create some kind of average price but doing it like this does not seem to be effective because large prices are weighted a lot stronger than low prices.

---

#### **[H-04] TwapOracle doesn't calculate VADER:USDV exchange rate correctly**

**Report Description**:  
The `consult()` function in `TwapOracle.sol` incorrectly calculates the exchange rate by multiplying `sumUSD` by the token's decimals instead of using a scaling factor (`10 ** decimals`). This leads to incorrect results, especially for tokens with 18 decimals. The issue is marked as high severity because the exchange rate is used in a minting mechanism, and the correctness of the oracle is a key focus of the audit.

**Match in Response List**:  
No direct match found. The response list does not address the specific issue of incorrect decimal handling in the `consult()` function.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not identify or address the core issue of incorrect decimal handling in the `consult()` function.

#### **[H-17] TWAPOracle might register with wrong token order**

**Report Description**:  
The `registerPair` function does not account for the possibility of reversed token order when calling `getPair` on the factory. This could lead to incorrect price calculations due to mismatched `price0CumulativeLast` and `price1CumulativeLast`.

**Match in Response List**:  
No direct match found. The response list does not address the issue of token order reversal in `registerPair`.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not identify or address the core issue of token order reversal in `registerPair`.

---

#### **[H-28] Incorrect Price Consultation Results**

**Report Description**:  
The `consult()` function iterates over token pairs and calculates prices based on UniswapV2 and Chainlink data. However, the logic for summing prices and calculating the final result may lead to incorrect price consultations.

**Match in Response List**:  
No direct match found. The response list does not address the specific issue of incorrect price consultation logic in `consult()`.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not identify or address the core issue of incorrect price consultation logic.

---

#### **[H-30] Newly Registered Assets Skew Consultation Results**

**Report Description**:  
Newly registered assets can skew consultation results because the `consult()` function uses default `price1Average` values until the next update interval. This leads to incorrect consultations, especially when Chainlink data is valid but the native asset amount is 0.

**Match in Response List**:  
No direct match found. The response list does not address the issue of skewed consultation results due to newly registered assets.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not identify or address the core issue of skewed consultation results.

---

#### **[M-01] Unbounded loop in TwapOracle.update can result in oracle being locked**

**Match in Response List**:  
No direct match found. The response list does not address the issue of unbounded loops in `update`.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not identify or address the core issue of unbounded loops in `update`.

---

#### **[M-03] Permissioned nature of TwapOracle allows owner to manipulate oracle**

**Report Description**:  
The `update` function is permissioned, allowing the owner to manipulate the oracle by delaying updates. This can lead to stale price data and inaccurate TWAP calculations.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Missing access control on the `update` function's impact""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the risk of owner manipulation in the `update` function and explains the potential impact on price calculations.

---

#### **[M-18] TWAPOracle.getRate does not scale the ratio**

**Report Description**:  
The `getRate()` function does not scale the ratio between `tUSDInUSDV` and `tUSDInVader`, leading to incorrect results. This issue is marked as medium severity due to its impact on the protocol's functionality.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Incorrect Decimal Handling in `getRate` Function""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue of incorrect decimal handling in `getRate()` and explains the potential impact on the rate calculation.

---

#### **[M-19] Unclear TwapOracle.consult algorithm**

**Report Description**:  
The `consult()` function's algorithm is unclear, and the weighting of prices may lead to inaccurate results. This issue is marked as medium severity due to its impact on the protocol's functionality.

**Match in Response List**:  
No direct match found. The response list does not address the issue of unclear algorithm logic in `consult()`.

}",1565,182,"[H-10] calculate Loss is vulnerable to flashloan attack

function `calculateLoss()`

The VaderPool would compensate users' IL. The formula it uses to calculate lp value is vulnerable to manipulation.
The formula to calculate the lp value is similar to warp finance which is known to be unsafe. warpfinance-incident-root-cause-analysis (Please to refer to the POC section)
The Attacker can purchase an old lp position, manipulate price, take IL compensation and drain the reserve. I consider this is a high-risk issue.
Proof of Concept

VaderMath.sol#L69-L93
The lp value is calculated as [(A0 * P1) + V0] and // [(A1 * P1) + V1]. Assume that there's an ETH pool and there's 100 ETH and 100 Vader in the pool.
Attacker deposit 1 ETH and 1 Vader and own 1% of the liquidity.
Wait 1 year
Start flash loan and buy a lot ETH with 99900 Vader.
There's 0.1 ETH 100,000 Vader in the pool.
Burn 1 % lp at the price 1 ETH = 1,000,000 Vader.
A0 * P1 + V0 = 1 (eth) * 1,000,000 (price) + 100 (vader)
A1 * P1 + V1 = 0.001 (eth) * 1,000,000 (price) + 10,000 (vader)
IL compensation would be around 9891000.
 [H-25] Wrong design of swap() results in unexpected and unfavorable outputs

Submitted by WatchPug
The current formula to calculate the amountOut for a swap is:
https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-vader/blob/429970427b4dc65e37808d7116b9de27e395ce0c/contracts/dex/math/VaderMath.sol#L99-L111
function calculateSwap(
    uint256 amountIn,
    uint256 reserveIn,
    uint256 reserveOut
) public pure returns (uint256 amountOut) {
    // x * Y * X
    uint256 numerator = amountIn * reserveIn * reserveOut;

    // (x + X) ^ 2
    uint256 denominator = pow(amountIn + reserveIn);

    amountOut = numerator / denominator;
}

We believe the design (the formula) is wrong and it will result in unexpected and unfavorable outputs.
Specifically, if the amountIn is larger than the reserveIn, the amountOut starts to decrease.

**Report Description**:  
The `calculateLoss()` function in `VaderPool` compensates users for impermanent loss (IL). However, the formula used to calculate the LP value is vulnerable to manipulation, similar to the Warp Finance incident. An attacker can purchase an old LP position, manipulate the price, claim IL compensation, and drain the reserve. This is a high-risk issue. The formula calculates the LP value as `[(A0 * P1) + V0]` and `[(A1 * P1) + V1]`. For example, in an ETH pool with 100 ETH and 100 Vader, an attacker can deposit 1 ETH and 1 Vader to own 1% of the liquidity. After waiting, they can use a flash loan to manipulate the price, burn the LP position, and claim excessive IL compensation.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of flash loan attacks or vulnerabilities in the `calculateLoss()` function. The provided findings focus on access control and reentrancy vulnerabilities, which are unrelated to the described issue.

---

### **[H-25] Wrong design of `swap()` results in unexpected and unfavorable outputs**

**Report Description**:  
The `swap()` function in `VaderMath.sol` uses a flawed formula to calculate `amountOut`. The formula is `(amountIn * reserveIn * reserveOut) / (amountIn + reserveIn)^2`. This design is problematic because if `amountIn` is larger than `reserveIn`, the `amountOut` starts to decrease, leading to unexpected and unfavorable outputs. This could result in inefficient swaps and potential financial losses for users.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of flawed swap calculations or the design of the `swap()` function. The provided findings focus on access control and reentrancy vulnerabilities, which are unrelated to the described issue.

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:  
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:  
- *None*

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:  
- **[H-10] calculate Loss is vulnerable to flashloan attack**  
- **[H-25] Wrong design of `swap()` results in unexpected and unfavorable outputs**

---

### **Analysis of Gaps**  
The `response_list` does not address the specific vulnerabilities described in the `issue` report. The findings in the response list focus on access control and reentrancy vulnerabilities, which are unrelated to the issues of flash loan attacks and flawed swap calculations. This indicates a significant gap in the coverage of the response list, as it fails to address critical high-risk vulnerabilities in the smart contract.","```

In the current implementation, the first liquidity takes the nativeDeposit amount and uses it directly.
However, since this number (totalLiquidityUnits) will later be used for computing the liquidity issued for future addLiquidity using calculateLiquidityUnits.
A malicious user can add liquidity with only 1 wei USDV and making it nearly impossible for future users to add liquidity to the pool.

#### **[H-11] (dex-v1) BasePool.mint() function can be frontrun**

**Report Description**:  
The `mint` function in the `BasePool` contract is susceptible to frontrunning. An attacker can frontrun a legitimate transaction, causing the NFT to be assigned to the attacker instead of the intended user. The attacker can then burn the NFT to retrieve the deposited `_nativeAsset` and `_foreignAsset`, effectively stealing the victim's funds.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential for Front-Running in `mint` and `swap` Functions""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the frontrunning vulnerability in the `mint` function. It explains the risks associated with frontrunning, including the potential for attackers to manipulate the transaction order to their advantage, which aligns with the issue described in the report.

---

#### **[H-20] Early user can break addLiquidity**

**Report Description**:  
In the `BasePool` contract, the first liquidity provider can set the initial liquidity units to the `nativeDeposit` amount. A malicious user can exploit this by depositing a minimal amount (e.g., 1 wei) of `USDV`, making it nearly impossible for future users to add liquidity to the pool. This disrupts the pool's functionality and fairness.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this specific issue. The described vulnerability is unique and not covered by any of the responses, which focus on other aspects of the contract's functionality.

---

#### **[M-13] BasePool.mint() Is Callable By Anyone**

**Report Description**:  
The `mint` function in `BasePool` lacks the `onlyRouter` modifier, allowing anyone to call it directly. This bypasses the input validation performed by the `VaderRouter.addLiquidity()` function, potentially leading to unintended behavior or exploitation.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the absence of the `onlyRouter` modifier in the `mint` function. This issue is specific to access control and is not covered by any of the responses.

---

#### **[M-14] BasePool.swap() Is Callable By Anyone**

**Report Description**:  
The `swap` function in `BasePool` lacks the `onlyRouter` modifier, allowing anyone to call it directly. This bypasses the input validation performed by the `VaderRouter._swap()` function, potentially leading to unintended behavior or exploitation.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the absence of the `onlyRouter` modifier in the `swap` function. This issue is specific to access control and is not covered by any of the responses.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:

- **[H-11] (dex-v1) BasePool.mint() function can be frontrun**

**Partially Correct Matches**:

- *None*

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:

- **[H-20] Early user can break addLiquidity**
- **[M-13] BasePool.mint() Is Callable By Anyone**
- **[M-14] BasePool.swap() Is Callable By Anyone**

---

### **Conclusion**

The response list partially covers the issues in the report, with only one issue (**[H-11]**) being correctly identified. The remaining issues (**[H-20]**, **[M-13]**, and **[M-14]**) are not addressed, indicating gaps in the response list's coverage of access control and liquidity manipulation vulnerabilities. To improve the response list, it should include specific checks for access control (e.g., `onlyRouter` modifier) and early liquidity provider exploits.","```
1. Potential for Front-Running in `mint` and `swap` Functions
```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the rank of the true positive**:
   - The true positive is ""Potential for Front-Running in `mint` and `swap` Functions"".
   - This issue appears at rank 5 in the ranked list of predictions.

2. **Calculate the precision at rank 5 (P@5)**:
   - Precision at rank \( k \) is calculated as the number of true positives up to rank \( k \) divided by \( k \).
   - Since there is only one true positive up to rank 5, \( P@5 = \frac{1}{5} = 0.2 \).

3. **Compute the Average Precision (AP)**:
   - Since there is only one true positive, the AP is simply the precision at the rank where the true positive appears.
   - Therefore, \( AP = 0.2 \).

**Output**:

Anyone can create a token pool.
Token price is set by the first lp provider.
User can get a synthetic asset.
Assume a new popular coin that the DAO decides to add to the protocol. The attacker can create the pool and set it to be extremely cheap. (By depositing 1 wei coin and 10^18 wei Vader.) The attacker can mint a lot of synth by providing another 10^18 wei Vader.

**Report Description**:  
The `createPool` function is permissionless, allowing anyone to create a token pool. The token price is set by the first liquidity provider (LP). An attacker can exploit this by front-running the creation of a pool for a new popular coin added by the DAO. By depositing a minimal amount of the new coin (e.g., 1 wei) and a large amount of Vader (e.g., 10^18 wei), the attacker can set the token price to be extremely cheap. This allows the attacker to mint a large amount of synthetic assets (synths) by providing another 10^18 wei of Vader, leading to significant financial manipulation and potential loss of funds.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential Front-Running Vulnerability in `createPool`""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the potential for front-running in the `createPool` function, which aligns with the core issue described in the report. However, the response does not fully capture the severity or the specific exploitation mechanism described in the report. The report highlights a critical financial manipulation risk where an attacker can set token prices artificially low and mint large amounts of synths, leading to significant financial impact. The response, while acknowledging the front-running risk, does not address the specific economic consequences or the detailed exploitation scenario. Therefore, it is **partially correct** but misses critical details about the impact and exploitation method.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:  
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:  
- **[H-12] Attacker can get extremely cheap synth by front-running create Pool**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:  
- *None*

---

### **Conclusion**  
The response list partially addresses the issue of front-running in the `createPool` function but fails to fully capture the severity and specific exploitation mechanism described in the report. The response should be expanded to include the financial manipulation risks and the detailed exploitation scenario to be considered fully correct.","```

",2501,343,"[H-15] VaderRouter._swap performs wrong swap

Submitted by cmichel
The 3-path hop in VaderRouter._swap is supposed to first swap foreign assets to native assets, and then the received native assets to different foreign assets again.
The pool.swap(nativeAmountIn, foreignAmountIn) accepts the foreign amount as the second argument. The code however mixes these positional arguments up and tries to perform a pool0 foreign -> native swap by using the foreign amount as the native amount:
function _swap(
    uint256 amountIn,
    address[] calldata path,
    address to
) private returns (uint256 amountOut) {
    if (path.length == 3) {
      // ...
      // @audit calls this with nativeAmountIn = amountIn. but should be foreignAmountIn (second arg)
      return pool1.swap(0, pool0.swap(amountIn, 0, address(pool1)), to);
    }
}

// @audit should be this instead
return pool1.swap(pool0.swap(0, amountIn, address(pool1)), 0, to);

**Report Description**:
The `_swap` function in `VaderRouter` is designed to handle a 3-path hop, where foreign assets are first swapped to native assets, and then the received native assets are swapped to different foreign assets. However, the function incorrectly passes the `foreign` amount as the `native` amount in the `pool.swap` call. This misplacement of arguments leads to incorrect swap behavior, potentially causing unintended token transfers and incorrect swap outcomes.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the specific issue of incorrect argument placement in the `_swap` function. The issue is unique to the logic of the `_swap` function and is not covered by any of the responses in the `response_list`.

### **[H-16] VaderRouter.calculateOutGivenIn calculates wrong swap**

**Report Description**:
The `calculateOutGivenIn` function in `VaderRouter` is supposed to calculate the output amount for a 3-path hop, where foreign assets are first swapped to native assets in `pool0`, and then the received native assets are swapped to different foreign assets in `pool1`. However, the function incorrectly swaps in `pool1` first instead of `pool0`, leading to incorrect calculations and potentially misleading swap outcomes.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the specific issue of incorrect swap order in the `calculateOutGivenIn` function. The issue is unique to the logic of the `calculateOutGivenIn` function and is not covered by any of the responses in the `response_list`.

### **Conclusion**
The `response_list` does not address the specific issues identified in the `issue` report. Both **[H-15]** and **[H-16]** are unique to the logic of the `VaderRouter` contract and are not covered by any of the responses in the `response_list`. These issues highlight critical vulnerabilities in the swap and calculation logic, which could lead to incorrect token transfers and misleading swap outcomes. It is recommended to address these issues by correcting the argument placement in the `_swap` function and ensuring the correct swap order in the `calculateOutGivenIn` function.","```
