#### **[H-01] Griefing / Blocking / Delaying Users to Withdraw**

**Report Description**:  
The `WithdrawHook` contract includes security mechanisms such as global and user-specific withdrawal limits within specific timeframes. These mechanisms can be activated to restrict withdrawals, potentially causing griefing, blocking, or delaying users from withdrawing their funds. Additionally, the contract collects fees during withdrawals.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential for DoS due to global limits""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the risk of Denial-of-Service (DoS) due to global withdrawal limits. It explains that if the `globalWithdrawLimitPerPeriod` is set too low or the `globalAmountWithdrawnThisPeriod` is close to the limit, legitimate users might be unable to withdraw their funds. This aligns with the issue's description of griefing/blocking users from withdrawing.

---

#### **[H-02] A Whale User is Able to Cause Freeze of Funds of Other Users by Bypassing Withdraw Limit**

**Report Description**:  
If less than `globalPeriodLength` seconds have passed since the global reset, the `hook()` function resets the time to `now` and sets the starting amount to the current requested amount. Otherwise, the new amount must not exceed the `globalWithdrawLimitPerPeriod`. A similar check is performed for user-specific variables. A whale user could exploit this logic to bypass withdrawal limits, causing a freeze of funds for other users.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Timestamp Dependence and Race Condition for Period Reset""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the risk of timestamp dependence and race conditions in the period reset logic. However, it does not explicitly address the scenario where a whale user could bypass withdrawal limits to freeze funds for other users. The response focuses on miners manipulating timestamps and concurrent transactions bypassing limits but misses the specific impact on other users.

---

#### **[M-01] Bypass `userWithdrawLimitPerPeriod` Check**

**Report Description**:  
A user can bypass the `userWithdrawLimitPerPeriod` check by transferring their balance to another account. This allows the user to circumvent the withdrawal limit imposed on their account.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The ability to bypass `userWithdrawLimitPerPeriod` by transferring balances to another account is a significant oversight and should have been identified as a separate vulnerability.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:  
- **[H-01] Griefing / Blocking / Delaying Users to Withdraw**

**Partially Correct Matches**:  
- **[H-02] A Whale User is Able to Cause Freeze of Funds of Other Users by Bypassing Withdraw Limit**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:  
- **[M-01] Bypass `userWithdrawLimitPerPeriod` Check**

---

### **Overall Assessment**  
The response list covers some of the issues in the `issue` report but misses critical vulnerabilities like the bypass of `userWithdrawLimitPerPeriod`. Additionally, while some issues are partially addressed, the responses could be more comprehensive in identifying the specific impacts and risks described in the `issue` report.","```
1. Potential for DoS due to global limits
```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the ranks at which the true positives appear in the ranked list of predictions**:
   - The true positive is: ""Potential for DoS due to global limits"".
   - This issue appears at rank 9 in the ranked list of predictions.

2. **Calculate the precision at that rank**:
   - Precision at rank 9 (\( P@9 \)) is calculated as the number of true positives up to rank 9 divided by 9.
   - Since there is only one true positive up to rank 9, \( P@9 = \frac{1}{9} \approx 0.1111 \).

3. **Average the precision values for all true positives**:
   - Since there is only one true positive, the **Average Precision (AP)** is simply \( P@9 \).

**Output**:
- The **Average Precision (AP)** for the query is approximately **0.1111**."

**Report Description**:
When an ERC20 token that deducts a fee on transfer is used as the `baseToken`, the recipient receives more collateral tokens than they should. This occurs because the contract does not account for the fee deducted during the transfer, leading to an imbalance in the collateral token minting process. This could allow users to exploit the system by receiving free collateral tokens, potentially draining the contract's reserves.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The issue is not addressed in the `response_list`. The response list does not cover the specific scenario where an ERC20 token deducts a fee on transfer, leading to incorrect collateral token minting. This is a significant oversight, as it directly impacts the contract's financial integrity.

---

### **[M-06] Manager can get around min reserves check, draining all funds from Collateral.sol**

**Report Description**:
When a manager withdraws funds from `Collateral.sol`, there is a check in the `managerWithdrawHook` to confirm that they aren't pushing the contract below the minimum reserve balance. However, a similar check does not occur in the `withdraw()` function. This oversight allows the manager to bypass the minimum reserve check, potentially draining all funds from the contract.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The issue is not addressed in the `response_list`. The response list does not mention the lack of a minimum reserve check in the `withdraw()` function, which is a critical vulnerability that could lead to the complete draining of the contract's funds.

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:
- **[M-02] The recipient receives free collateral token if an ERC20 token that deducts a fee on transfer used as baseToken**
- **[M-06] Manager can get around min reserves check, draining all funds from Collateral.sol**

---

### **Conclusion**
The `response_list` does not adequately address the issues raised in the `issue` report. Both **[M-02]** and **[M-06]** are critical vulnerabilities that are entirely missed in the response list. This indicates a significant gap in the coverage of the response list, particularly in addressing issues related to fee-on-transfer tokens and minimum reserve checks.","```

",1752,163,"[M-03] Frontrunning for unallowed minting of Short and Long tokens
The problem is, that as long as the `_mintHook` is not set via `setMintHook`, everyone can use the mint function and mint short and long tokens. At the moment the `_mintHook` is not set in the contructor of PrePOMarket and so the transaction that will set the `_mintHook` can be front run to mint short and long tokens for the attacker.   [M-05] PrePOMarket.setFinalLongPayout() shouldn't be called twice.
If `finalLongPayout` is changed twice by admin fault, the market would be insolvent as it should pay more collateral than it has.

**[M-03] Frontrunning for unallowed minting of Short and Long tokens**

**Report Description**:  
The issue arises because the `_mintHook` is not set in the constructor of `PrePOMarket`. Until `setMintHook` is called, anyone can use the `mint` function to mint Short and Long tokens. This creates a frontrunning vulnerability where an attacker can mint tokens before the `_mintHook` is set, potentially exploiting the system.

**Match in Response List**:  
No match found.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the specific issue of frontrunning due to the unset `_mintHook` in the constructor. While the response list discusses potential reentrancy vulnerabilities with market hooks, it does not cover the frontrunning risk associated with the uninitialized `_mintHook`. This is a missed issue in the response list.

---

**[M-05] PrePOMarket.setFinalLongPayout() shouldn't be called twice**

**Report Description**:  
The `setFinalLongPayout` function allows the admin to set the final payout for the market. If this function is called twice, it could lead to insolvency, as the market might be required to pay more collateral than it holds. This could occur due to an admin error or a malicious actor manipulating the payout value.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Possible denial of service attack vector when setting the final payout""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the risk of calling `setFinalLongPayout` multiple times, which aligns with the issue report. However, the response focuses more on the potential for griefing attacks and manipulation of the payout value rather than the specific risk of insolvency due to overpaying collateral. The response could have been more precise in addressing the financial impact of calling the function twice.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:  
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:  
- **[M-05] PrePOMarket.setFinalLongPayout() shouldn't be called twice**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:  
- **[M-03] Frontrunning for unallowed minting of Short and Long tokens**

--- 

### **Conclusion**  
The response list partially addresses one of the issues but misses the other entirely. The issue of frontrunning due to the unset `_mintHook` is not covered, and the response to the `setFinalLongPayout` issue lacks specificity regarding the insolvency risk. Improvements are needed to ensure comprehensive coverage of all reported vulnerabilities.","```
