",3311,517,"[H-01] VaderPoolV2 minting synths & fungibles can be frontrun

The VaderPoolV2 `mintFungible` and `mintSynth` functions perform an unsafe nativeAsset.safeTransferFrom(from, address(this), nativeDeposit) with a parameter-specified from address.
Note that these functions are not called by the Router, they are directly called on the pool. Therefore, users will usually be required to send two transactions, a first one approving the pool, and then a second one for the actual mintSynth.
An attacker can frontrun the mintSynth(IERC20 foreignAsset, uint256 nativeDeposit, address from, address to) function, use the same from=victim parameter but change the to parameter to the attacker.
 [H-02] VaderPoolV2 owner can steal all user assets which are approved VaderPoolV2


Possible theft of all user assets with an ERC20 approval on VaderPoolV2.
Proof of Concept

The owner of VaderPoolV2 can call the setTokenSupport function which allows the caller to supply any address from which to take the assets to provide the initial liquidity, the owner can also specify who shall receive the resulting LP NFT and so can take ownership over these assets. This call will succeed for any address which has an ERC20 approval on VaderPoolV2 for USDV and foreignAsset.
https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-vader/blob/00ed84015d4116da2f9db0c68db6742c89e73f65/contracts/dex-v2/pool/VaderPoolV2.sol#L442-L474
This in effect gives custody over all assets in user wallets which are approved on VaderPoolV2 to Vader Protocol governance. This is especially problematic in the case of Vader Protocol as there's a single entity (i.e. the Council) which can force through a proposal to steal these assets for themselves with only the timelock giving protection to users, for this reason I give this high severity.
  [H-07] Redemption value of synths can be manipulated to drain VaderPoolV2 of all native assets in the associated pair

Draining of funds from VaderPoolV2.

See the `VaderPool.mintSynth` function: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-vader/blob/fd2787013608438beae361ce1bb6d9ffba466c45/contracts/dex-v2/pool/VaderPoolV2.sol#L153-L194
As the pool's reserves can be manipulated through flashloans similar to on UniswapV2 (the slip mechanism can be mitigated by splitting the manipulation over a number of trades), an attacker may set the exchange rate between nativeAsset and synths (calculated from the reserves). An attacker can exploit this to drain funds from the pool.

Although the functions are marked as `nonReentrant`, if the called `synth` contract calls back into a different function within `VaderPoolV2` that isn't protected by the same reentrancy guard, a vulnerability could arise. Furthermore, the mintSynth function uses ISynthFactory to create synths if they don't exist via `synthFactory.createSynth`. Depending on the implementation of the SynthFactory and the Synths, this external call may be vulnerable to a reentrancy attack.

}",227.42142367362976,4988.0,38.0,"### **[H-01] VaderPoolV2 minting synths & fungibles can be frontrun**

**Report Description**:
The `mintFungible` and `mintSynth` functions in `VaderPoolV2` perform an unsafe `nativeAsset.safeTransferFrom(from, address(this), nativeDeposit)` with a parameter-specified `from` address. These functions are not called by the Router but directly on the pool, requiring users to send two transactions: one to approve the pool and another to mint. An attacker can frontrun the `mintSynth` function, using the same `from=victim` parameter but changing the `to` parameter to the attacker's address, effectively stealing the victim's assets.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Lack of slippage control in `mintSynth` and `burnSynth` can lead to front-running attacks""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the risk of front-running in `mintSynth` and `burnSynth` but focuses on slippage control rather than the specific issue of parameter manipulation in `safeTransferFrom`. While the response correctly highlights the front-running risk, it misses the critical detail of how the `from` address can be exploited. Therefore, it is partially correct.

---

### **[H-02] VaderPoolV2 owner can steal all user assets which are approved VaderPoolV2**

**Report Description**:
The owner of `VaderPoolV2` can call the `setTokenSupport` function, which allows the caller to specify any address from which to take assets for initial liquidity and who shall receive the resulting LP NFT. This call will succeed for any address with an ERC20 approval on `VaderPoolV2` for `USDV` and `foreignAsset`. This effectively gives the owner custody over all assets in user wallets approved on `VaderPoolV2`, posing a significant risk, especially given the centralized governance structure of Vader Protocol.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Lack of Input Validation in `setTokenSupport`""**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response discusses the lack of input validation in `setTokenSupport` but does not address the critical issue of the owner's ability to steal user assets. The response focuses on the potential for price manipulation and unfair treatment of liquidity providers, which is unrelated to the reported issue. Therefore, it is incorrect.

---

### **[H-07] Redemption value of synths can be manipulated to drain VaderPoolV2 of all native assets in the associated pair**

**Report Description**:
The `mintSynth` function in `VaderPoolV2` calculates the exchange rate between `nativeAsset` and synths based on the pool's reserves. These reserves can be manipulated through flashloans, similar to UniswapV2, allowing an attacker to set the exchange rate and drain funds from the pool. The slip mechanism can be mitigated by splitting the manipulation over multiple trades, making the attack feasible.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Lack of slippage control in `mintSynth` and `burnSynth` can lead to front-running attacks""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the lack of slippage control in `mintSynth` and `burnSynth`, which is related to the reported issue. However, it does not specifically address the risk of reserve manipulation through flashloans or the potential for draining the pool. Therefore, it is partially correct.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:
- **[H-01] VaderPoolV2 minting synths & fungibles can be frontrun**
- **[H-07] Redemption value of synths can be manipulated to drain VaderPoolV2 of all native assets in the associated pair**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:
- **[H-02] VaderPoolV2 owner can steal all user assets which are approved VaderPoolV2**

---

The response list partially addresses some issues but misses critical details or misidentifies the core vulnerabilities in several cases. Specifically, the response fails to address the owner's ability to steal user assets in `setTokenSupport`, which is a high-severity issue. Additionally, while front-running and slippage risks are identified, the specific mechanisms of exploitation are not fully covered.","```

function `_calculateVaderPrice`
Invalid values returned from oracle for USDV and VADER prices in situations where the oracle uses more than one foreign asset.
  [H-04] Vader TWAP averages wrong  function `syncVaderPrice()`

The vader price in LiquidityBasedTWAP.getVaderPrice is computed using the pastLiquidityWeights and pastTotalLiquidityWeight return values of the syncVaderPrice.
The syncVaderPrice function does not initialize all weights and the total liquidity weight does not equal the sum of the individual weights because it skips initializing the pair with the previous data if the TWAP update window has not been reached yet:
  [H-05] Oracle returns an improperly scaled USDV/VADER price

Invalid values returned from oracle in vast majority of situations.
Proof of Concept

The LBT oracle does not properly scale values when calculating prices for VADER or USDV. To show this we consider the simplest case where we expect USDV to return a value of $1 and show that the oracle does not return this value.
Consider the case of the LBT oracle tracking a single USDV-DAI pair where USDV trades 1:1 for DAI and Chainlink reports that DAI is exactly $1. We then work through the lines linked below:
  [H-06] LPs of VaderPoolV2 can manipulate pool reserves to extract funds from the reserve.

Submitted by TomFrenchBlockchain, also found by hyh
Impermanent loss protection can be exploited to drain the reserve.
Proof of Concept

In VaderPoolV2.burn we calculate the current losses that the LP has made to impermanent loss.
https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-vader/blob/fd2787013608438beae361ce1bb6d9ffba466c45/contracts/dex-v2/pool/VaderPoolV2.sol#L265-L296
These losses are then refunded to the LP in VADER tokens from the reserve.

This loss is calculated by the current reserves of the pool so if an LP can manipulate the pool's reserves they can artificially engineer a huge amount of IL in order to qualify for a payout up to the size of their LP position.

  [H-10] previousPrices Is Never Updated Upon Syncing Token Price
Variables `previousPrices` 
The LiquidityBasedTWAP contract attempts to accurately track the price of VADER and USDV while still being resistant to flash loan manipulation and short-term volatility. The previousPrices array is meant to track the last queried price for the two available paths, namely VADER and USDV.
The setupVader function configures the VADER token by setting previousPrices and adding a token pair. However, syncVaderPrice does not update previousPrices after syncing, causing currentLiquidityEvaluation to be dependent on the initial price for VADER. As a result, liquidity weightings do not accurately reflect the current and most up to date price for VADER.
This same issue also affects how USDV calculates currentLiquidityEvaluation.
This issue is of high risk and heavily impacts the accuracy of the TWAP implementation as the set price for VADER/USDV diverges from current market prices. For example, as the Chainlink oracle price and initial price for VADER diverge, currentLiquidityEvaluation will begin to favour either on-chain or off-chain price data depending on which price result is greater. The following calculation for currentLiquidityEvaluation outlines this behaviour.
currentLiquidityEvaluation =
    (reserveNative * previousPrices[uint256(Paths.VADER)]) +
    (reserveForeign * getChainlinkPrice(pairData.foreignAsset));
  [H-11] `totalLiquidityWeight` Is Updated When Adding New Token Pairs Which Skews Price Data For `getVaderPrice` and `getUSDVPrice`

The `_addVaderPair` function is called by the onlyOwner role. The relevant data in the twapData mapping is set by querying the respective liquidity pool and Chainlink oracle. totalLiquidityWeight for the VADER path is also incremented by the pairLiquidityEvaluation amount (calculated within _addVaderPair). If a user then calls syncVaderPrice, the recently updated totalLiquidityWeight will be taken into consideration when iterating through all token pairs eligible for price updates to calculate the liquidity weight for each token pair. This data is stored in pastTotalLiquidityWeight and pastLiquidityWeights respectively.
As a result, newly added token pairs will increase pastTotalLiquidityWeight while leaving pastLiquidityWeights underrepresented. This only occurs if syncVaderPrice is called before the update period for the new token has not been passed.
This issue also affects how the price for USDV is synced.
  [H-12] Using single total native reserve variable for synth and non-synth reserves of VaderPoolV2 can lead to losses for synth holders

Users that `mint synths` do provide native assets, increasing native reserve pool, but do not get any liquidity shares issued. In the same time, an exit of non-synth liquidity provider yields releasing a proportion of all current reserves to him.
Whenever an exit of non-synth LP is substantial enough, the system will have much less native asset regarding the cumulative deposit of synth holders. That is, when a LP entered he provided a share of current reserves, both native and foreign, and got the corresponding liquidity shares in return. Suppose then big enough amounts of synths were minted, providing correspondingly big enough amount of native assets. If the LP now wants to exit, he will obtain a part of total native assets, including a part of the amount that was provided by synth minter. If the exit is big enough there will be substantially less native assets left to reimburse the synth minter than he initially provided. This is not reversible: the synth minters lost their native assets to LP that exited.
  [H-14] Denial of service

Submitted by danb
https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-vader/blob/main/contracts/dex-v2/pool/VaderPoolV2.sol#L334 on the first deposit, the total liquidity is set to nativeDeposit. this might be a very low number compared to foreignDeposit. It can cause a denial of service of the pair.

A pair can enter a denial of service state.

[M-01] VaderPoolV2.mintFungible exposes users to unlimited slippage
TOD

Frontrunners can extract up to 100% of the value provided by LPs to VaderPoolV2 as fungible liquidity.
Proof of Concept

Users can provide liquidity to VaderPoolV2 through the mintFungible function.
https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-vader/blob/fd2787013608438beae361ce1bb6d9ffba466c45/contracts/dex-v2/pool/VaderPoolV2.sol#L311-L317
This allows users to provide tokens in any ratio and the pool will calculate what fraction of the value in the pool this makes up and mint the corresponding amount of liquidity units as an ERC20.
However there's no way for users to specify the minimum number of liquidity units they will accept. As the number of liquidity units minted is calculated from the current reserves, this allows frontrunners to manipulate the pool's reserves in such a way that the LP receives fewer liquidity units than they should. e.g. LP provid
  [M-02] Adding pair of the same foreignAsset would replace oracle of earlier entry

Submitted by gzeon
Oracles are mapped to the foreignAsset but not to the specific pair. Pairs with the same foreignAsset (e.g. UniswapV2 and Sushi) will be forced to use the same oracle. Generally this should be the expected behavior but there are also possibility that while adding a new pair changed the oracle of an older pair unexpectedly.

---

#### **[H-03] Oracle doesn't calculate USDV/VADER price correctly**

**Report Description**:  
The function `_calculateVaderPrice` returns invalid values for USDV and VADER prices when the oracle uses more than one foreign asset. This leads to incorrect price calculations, especially in scenarios involving multiple foreign assets.

**Match in Response List**:  
No direct match found. The response list does not address the specific issue of incorrect price calculations when multiple foreign assets are involved.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not cover the issue of incorrect price calculations due to multiple foreign assets, which is a critical vulnerability.

---

#### **[H-04] Vader TWAP averages wrong**

**Report Description**:  
The `syncVaderPrice` function computes the VADER price using `pastLiquidityWeights` and `pastTotalLiquidityWeight`, but it does not initialize all weights correctly. This leads to inaccurate TWAP calculations, especially when the TWAP update window has not been reached.

**Match in Response List**:  
No direct match found. The response list does not address the issue of incorrect initialization of weights in `syncVaderPrice`.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not cover the issue of incorrect weight initialization, which is a critical vulnerability.

---

#### **[H-05] Oracle returns an improperly scaled USDV/VADER price**

**Report Description**:  
The LBT oracle does not properly scale values when calculating prices for VADER or USDV. This leads to incorrect price calculations, even in simple scenarios where USDV should return a value of $1.

**Match in Response List**:  
No direct match found. The response list does not address the issue of improper scaling in price calculations.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not cover the issue of improper scaling, which is a critical vulnerability.

---

#### **[H-06] LPs of VaderPoolV2 can manipulate pool reserves to extract funds from the reserve**

**Report Description**:  
LPs can manipulate pool reserves to exploit impermanent loss protection, allowing them to drain the reserve. This is achieved by artificially engineering a large amount of impermanent loss to qualify for a payout.

**Match in Response List**:  
No direct match found. The response list does not address the issue of reserve manipulation in `VaderPoolV2`.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not cover the issue of reserve manipulation, which is a critical vulnerability.

---

#### **[H-10] previousPrices Is Never Updated Upon Syncing Token Price**

**Report Description**:  
The `previousPrices` array is not updated after syncing, causing `currentLiquidityEvaluation` to depend on the initial price for VADER. This leads to inaccurate TWAP calculations as the price diverges from the market price.

**Match in Response List**:  
No direct match found. The response list does not address the issue of `previousPrices` not being updated.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not cover the issue of `previousPrices` not being updated, which is a critical vulnerability.

---

#### **[H-11] totalLiquidityWeight Is Updated When Adding New Token Pairs Which Skews Price Data For getVaderPrice and getUSDVPrice**

**Report Description**:  
The `totalLiquidityWeight` is updated when adding new token pairs, skewing price data for `getVaderPrice` and `getUSDVPrice`. This leads to inaccurate TWAP calculations, especially if `syncVaderPrice` is called before the update period for the new token has passed.

**Match in Response List**:  
No direct match found. The response list does not address the issue of `totalLiquidityWeight` being skewed by new token pairs.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not cover the issue of `totalLiquidityWeight` being skewed, which is a critical vulnerability.

---

#### **[H-12] Using single total native reserve variable for synth and non-synth reserves of VaderPoolV2 can lead to losses for synth holders**

**Report Description**:  
Using a single total native reserve variable for both synth and non-synth reserves can lead to losses for synth holders when non-synth LPs exit. This is because the exiting LP can take a portion of the native assets provided by synth holders.

**Match in Response List**:  
No direct match found. The response list does not address the issue of losses for synth holders due to shared native reserves.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not cover the issue of losses for synth holders, which is a critical vulnerability.

---

#### **[H-14] Denial of service**

**Report Description**:  
On the first deposit, the total liquidity is set to `nativeDeposit`, which might be a very low number compared to `foreignDeposit`. This can cause a denial of service for the pair.

**Match in Response List**:  
No direct match found. The response list does not address the issue of denial of service due to low initial liquidity.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not cover the issue of denial of service, which is a critical vulnerability.

---

#### **[M-01] VaderPoolV2.mintFungible exposes users to unlimited slippage**

**Report Description**:  
The `mintFungible` function does not allow users to specify a minimum number of liquidity units they will accept, exposing them to unlimited slippage. Frontrunners can manipulate the pool's reserves to extract value from LPs.

**Match in Response List**:  
No direct match found. The response list does not address the issue of unlimited slippage in `mintFungible`.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not cover the issue of unlimited slippage, which is a medium-severity vulnerability.

---

#### **[M-02] Adding pair of the same foreignAsset would replace oracle of earlier entry**

**Report Description**:  
Adding a pair with the same `foreignAsset` replaces the oracle of the earlier entry, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the oracle is changed.

**Match in Response List**:  
No direct match found. The response list does not address the issue of oracle replacement when adding pairs with the same `foreignAsset`.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not cover the issue of oracle replacement, which is a medium-severity vulnerability.

function `reimburseImpermanentLoss`
Reserve pays out vastly higher (or lower) IL protection than it should.

Consider the lines 98 and 102 as shown on the link below:
https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-vader/blob/00ed84015d4116da2f9db0c68db6742c89e73f65/contracts/reserve/VaderReserve.sol#L95-L103


[M-04] VaderReserve.reimburseImpermanentLoss improperly converts USDV to VADER

Submitted by TomFrenchBlockchain
IL isn't properly converted from being in terms of USDV to VADER, resulting in reserve paying out incorrect amount.
Proof of Concept

VaderReserve.reimburseImpermanentLoss receives an amount in terms of USDV and converts this to an amount of VADER to send to recipient.
However as shown in the link if there is a previous price stored for USDV, the amount of VADER tokens to be sent to the recipient is amount / usdvPrice.

**Report Description**:
The `reimburseImpermanentLoss` function in `VaderReserve.sol` improperly converts USDV to VADER, resulting in incorrect reimbursement amounts. Specifically, the function calculates the amount of VADER to send based on the USDV price, but the conversion logic is flawed. If there is a previous price stored for USDV, the amount of VADER tokens to be sent is calculated as `amount / usdvPrice`, which may lead to over- or under-compensation for impermanent loss. This issue arises from incorrect price application and could result in significant financial discrepancies.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Incorrect Calculation of Amount to Transfer in `reimburseImpermanentLoss`""**.

**Validation**:
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue with the incorrect calculation of the amount to transfer in the `reimburseImpermanentLoss` function. It correctly highlights that the conversion logic involving `usdvPrice` and `vaderPrice` is flawed, which aligns with the reported issue. The response also mentions the potential for under- or over-compensation, which is consistent with the impact described in the issue report.

### **[M-04] VaderReserve.reimburseImpermanentLoss improperly converts USDV to VADER**

**Report Description**:
The `reimburseImpermanentLoss` function in `VaderReserve.sol` improperly converts USDV to VADER, leading to incorrect reimbursement amounts. The function receives an `amount` in terms of USDV and converts it to VADER using `amount / usdvPrice`. However, this conversion logic is incorrect, as it does not account for the intended relationship between USDV and VADER prices. This flaw could result in the reserve paying out incorrect amounts, leading to financial losses or overpayments.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Incorrect Calculation of Amount to Transfer in `reimburseImpermanentLoss`""**.

**Validation**:
**Correct**. The response correctly identifies the issue with the improper conversion of USDV to VADER in the `reimburseImpermanentLoss` function. It accurately describes the flawed logic involving `usdvPrice` and `vaderPrice`, which is consistent with the issue report. The response also highlights the potential for incorrect reimbursement amounts, which matches the impact described in the issue.

1. Incorrect Calculation of Amount to Transfer in `reimburseImpermanentLoss`
```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the rank of the true positive**:
   - The true positive is ""Incorrect Calculation of Amount to Transfer in `reimburseImpermanentLoss`"".
   - From the ranked list of predictions, this issue appears at rank 8.

2. **Calculate the precision at rank 8**:
   - Precision at rank \( k \) (\( P@k \)) is calculated as the number of true positives up to rank \( k \) divided by \( k \).
   - Since there is only one true positive up to rank 8, \( P@8 = \frac{1}{8} = 0.125 \).

3. **Compute the Average Precision (AP)**:
   - Since there is only one true positive, the AP is simply the precision at the rank where the true positive appears.
   - Therefore, \( AP = 0.125 \).

**Output**:

}",1485,223,"[H-09] USDV.sol Mint and Burn Amounts Are Incorrect

Submitted by leastwood, also found by TomFrenchBlockchain
The USDV.mint function queries the price of Vader from the LiquidityBasedTwap contract. The calculation to determine uAmount in mint is actually performed incorrectly. uAmount = (vPrice * vAmount) / 1e18; will return the USD amount for the provided Vader as vPrice is denominated in USD/Vader. This uAmount is subsequently used when minting tokens for the user (locked for a period of time) and fee to the contract owner.
This same issue also applies to how vAmount = (uPrice * uAmount) / 1e18; is calculated in USDV.burn.
This is a severe issue, as the mint and burn functions will always use an incorrect amount of tokens, leading to certain loss by either the protocol (if the user profits) or the user (if the user does not profit).

}",169.39061188697815,3517.0,29.0,"### **[H-09] USDV.sol Mint and Burn Amounts Are Incorrect**

**Report Description**:
The `USDV.mint` function queries the price of `Vader` from the `LiquidityBasedTwap` contract. The calculation to determine `uAmount` in `mint` is performed incorrectly: `uAmount = (vPrice * vAmount) / 1e18`. This formula returns the USD amount for the provided `Vader` as `vPrice` is denominated in `USD/Vader`. This incorrect `uAmount` is subsequently used when minting tokens for the user (locked for a period of time) and the fee to the contract owner. The same issue applies to the calculation of `vAmount = (uPrice * uAmount) / 1e18` in `USDV.burn`. This is a severe issue, as the `mint` and `burn` functions will always use incorrect amounts of tokens, leading to certain loss by either the protocol (if the user profits) or the user (if the user does not profit).

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential precision loss when calculating mint amount""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the issue of precision loss in the calculations of `uAmount` and `vAmount` in the `mint` and `burn` functions. However, it does not fully capture the severity of the issue, which is the incorrect calculation of token amounts leading to certain losses for either the protocol or the user. The response focuses on precision loss rather than the fundamental flaw in the calculation logic, which is the core issue in the report.
