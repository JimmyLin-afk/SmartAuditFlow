}",3357,388,"[H-01] Can force borrower to pay huge interest
In the function `lend()`, the loan amount is used as a min loan amount. It can be matched as high as possible (realistically up to the collateral NFT's worth to remain in profit) and the borrower has to pay interest on the entire amount instead of just on the desired loan amount when the loan was created.
  [H-02] currentLoanOwner can manipulate loanInfo when any lenders try to buyout
If an attacker already calls `lend()` to lend to a loan, the attacker can manipulate `loanInfo` by reentrancy attack when any lenders try to buyout. The attacker can set bad values of lendInfo (e.g. very long duration, and 0 interest rate) that the lender who wants to buyout don't expect.

[H-03] Borrower can be their own lender and steal funds from buyout due to reentrancy
If borrower lends their own loan, they can repay and close the loan before ownership of the lend ticket is transferred to the new lender. The borrower will keep the NFT + loan amount + accrued interest.  [M-01] When an attacker lends to a loan, the attacker can trigger DoS that any lenders can not buyout it
If an attacker (lender) lends to a loan, the attacker can always revert transactions when any lenders try to buyout, making anyone can not buyout the loan of the attacker.   [M-02] Protocol doesn't handle fee on transfer tokens
Since the borrower is able to specify any asset token, it is possible that loans will be created with tokens that support fee on transfer. If a fee on transfer asset token is chosen, the protocol will contain a point of failure on the original `lend()` call.

[M-03] sendCollateralTo is unchecked in closeLoan(), which can cause user's collateral NFT to be frozen
The `sendCollateralTo` will receive the collateral NFT when `closeLoan()` is called. However, if `sendCollateralTo` is a contract address that does not support ERC721, the collateral NFT can be frozen in the contract.   [M-04] `requiredImprovementRate` can not work as expected when `previousInterestRate` less than 10 due to precision loss   [M-05] Borrowers lose funds if they call `repayAndCloseLoan` instead of `closeLoan`
The `repayAndCloseLoan` function does not revert if there has not been a lender for a loan (matched with `lend`). Users should use closeLoan in this case but the contract should disallow calling `repayAndCloseLoan` because users can lose funds.
It performs a `ERC20(loan.loanAssetContractAddress).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, lender, interest + loan.loanAmount)` call where interest will be a high value accumulated from timestamp 0 and the loan.loanAmount is the initially desired min loan amount `minLoanAmount` set in `createLoan`. The user will lose these funds if they ever approved the contract (for example, for another loan).

[M-06] Might not get desired min loan amount if _originationFeeRate changes
Admins can update the origination fee by calling `updateOriginationFeeRate`. Note that a borrower does not receive their `minLoanAmount` set in createLoan, they only receive `(1 - originationFee) * minLoanAmount`, see lend. Therefore, they need to precalculate the `minLoanAmount` using the `current` origination fee to arrive at the post-fee amount that they actually receive. If admins then increase the fee, the borrower receives fewer funds than required to cover their rent and might become homeless.
  [M-07] `mintBorrowTicketTo` can be a contract with no `onERC721Received` method, which may cause the `BorrowTicket NFT` to be frozen and put users' funds at risk

#### **[H-01] Can force borrower to pay huge interest**

**Report Description**:  
In the function `lend()`, the loan amount is used as a min loan amount. It can be matched as high as possible (realistically up to the collateral NFT's worth to remain in profit), and the borrower has to pay interest on the entire amount instead of just on the desired loan amount when the loan was created.

**Match in Response List**:  
No match found.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The issue highlights a potential financial risk to borrowers due to the lack of constraints on the loan amount in `lend()`, but this is not covered in the response list.

---

#### **[H-02] currentLoanOwner can manipulate loanInfo when any lenders try to buyout**

**Report Description**:  
If an attacker already calls `lend()` to lend to a loan, the attacker can manipulate `loanInfo` by reentrancy attack when any lenders try to buyout. The attacker can set bad values of `lendInfo` (e.g., very long duration and 0 interest rate) that the lender who wants to buyout doesn't expect.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Reentrancy Vulnerability in lend() and repayAndCloseLoan() functions""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the reentrancy vulnerability in `lend()`, which aligns with the issue report. The response also explains the potential for unexpected state changes and fund manipulation, which covers the core concern of the issue.

---

#### **[H-03] Borrower can be their own lender and steal funds from buyout due to reentrancy**

**Report Description**:  
If the borrower lends their own loan, they can repay and close the loan before ownership of the lend ticket is transferred to the new lender. The borrower will keep the NFT + loan amount + accrued interest.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Reentrancy Vulnerability in lend() and repayAndCloseLoan() functions""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response identifies the reentrancy vulnerability in `repayAndCloseLoan()`, which aligns with the issue report. The response also explains the potential for fund theft and unexpected state changes, which covers the core concern of the issue.

---

#### **[M-01] When an attacker lends to a loan, the attacker can trigger DoS that any lenders can not buyout it**

**Report Description**:  
If an attacker (lender) lends to a loan, the attacker can always revert transactions when any lenders try to buyout, making anyone unable to buyout the loan of the attacker.

**Match in Response List**:  
No match found.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The issue highlights a potential denial of service (DoS) attack vector, but this is not covered in the response list.

---

#### **[M-02] Protocol doesn't handle fee on transfer tokens**

**Report Description**:  
Since the borrower is able to specify any asset token, it is possible that loans will be created with tokens that support fee on transfer. If a fee on transfer asset token is chosen, the protocol will contain a point of failure on the original `lend()` call.

**Match in Response List**:  
No match found.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The issue highlights a potential failure point due to fee-on-transfer tokens, but this is not covered in the response list.

---

#### **[M-03] sendCollateralTo is unchecked in closeLoan(), which can cause user's collateral NFT to be frozen**

**Report Description**:  
The `sendCollateralTo` will receive the collateral NFT when `closeLoan()` is called. However, if `sendCollateralTo` is a contract address that does not support ERC721, the collateral NFT can be frozen in the contract.

**Match in Response List**:  
No match found.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The issue highlights a potential risk of NFT freezing due to unchecked contract addresses, but this is not covered in the response list.

---

#### **[M-04] requiredImprovementRate can not work as expected when previousInterestRate less than 10 due to precision loss**

**Match in Response List**:  
No match found.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The issue highlights a potential precision loss issue in the `requiredImprovementRate` calculation, but this is not covered in the response list.

---

#### **[M-05] Borrowers lose funds if they call repayAndCloseLoan instead of closeLoan**

**Report Description**:  
The `repayAndCloseLoan` function does not revert if there has not been a lender for a loan (matched with `lend`). Users should use `closeLoan` in this case, but the contract should disallow calling `repayAndCloseLoan` because users can lose funds. It performs a `ERC20(loan.loanAssetContractAddress).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, lender, interest + loan.loanAmount)` call where `interest` will be a high value accumulated from timestamp 0 and the `loan.loanAmount` is the initially desired min loan amount `minLoanAmount` set in `createLoan`. The user will lose these funds if they ever approved the contract (for example, for another loan).

**Match in Response List**:  
No match found.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The issue highlights a potential financial loss due to incorrect function usage, but this is not covered in the response list.

---

#### **[M-06] Might not get desired min loan amount if _originationFeeRate changes**

**Report Description**:  
Admins can update the origination fee by calling `updateOriginationFeeRate`. Note that a borrower does not receive their `minLoanAmount` set in `createLoan`; they only receive `(1 - originationFee) * minLoanAmount`, see `lend`. Therefore, they need to precalculate the `minLoanAmount` using the `current` origination fee to arrive at the post-fee amount that they actually receive. If admins then increase the fee, the borrower receives fewer funds than required to cover their rent and might become homeless.

**Match in Response List**:  
No match found.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The issue highlights a potential financial risk due to changes in the origination fee, but this is not covered in the response list.

---

#### **[M-07] mintBorrowTicketTo can be a contract with no onERC721Received method, which may cause the BorrowTicket NFT to be frozen and put users' funds at risk**

**Report Description**:  
`IERC721Mintable(borrowTicketContract).mint(mintBorrowTicketTo, id);`

**Match in Response List**:  
No match found.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The issue highlights a potential risk of NFT freezing due to unchecked contract addresses, but this is not covered in the response list.

The response list focuses heavily on reentrancy vulnerabilities but fails to address other critical issues such as DoS attacks, fee-on-transfer tokens, and precision loss. Significant gaps remain in the coverage of the issue report.","```
1. Reentrancy Vulnerability in lend() and repayAndCloseLoan() functions
```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the rank of the true positive**:
   - The true positive is ""Reentrancy Vulnerability in lend() and repayAndCloseLoan() functions"".
   - This issue appears at rank 1 in the ranked list of predictions.

2. **Calculate the precision at that rank**:
   - Precision at rank 1 (\( P@1 \)) is calculated as the number of true positives up to rank 1 divided by the rank itself.
   - Since there is 1 true positive at rank 1, \( P@1 = \frac{1}{1} = 1.0 \).

3. **Compute the Average Precision (AP)**:
   - Since there is only one true positive, the AP is simply the precision at the rank where the true positive appears.
   - Therefore, \( AP = 1.0 \).

**Output**:
```
1.0
