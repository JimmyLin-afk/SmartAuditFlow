MasterChef.sol#L86
When adding new token pool for staking in MasterChef contract ```
function add(address _token, uint _allocationPoints, uint16 _depositFee, uint _startBlock)
```
All other, already added, pools should be updated but currently they are not. Instead, only totalPoints is updated. Therefore, old (and not updated) pools will lose it's share during the next update. Therefore, user rewards are not computed correctly (will be always smaller).
  [H-02] Masterchef: Improper handling of deposit fee

Submitted by hickuphh3, also found by leastwood
MasterChef.sol#L170-L172
If a pool’s deposit fee is non-zero, it is subtracted from the amount to be credited to the user.
``` if (pool.depositFeeBP > 0) {
  uint depositFee = _amount.mul(pool.depositFeeBP).div(_perMille);
  user.amount = SafeCast.toUint128(user.amount + _amount - depositFee);
}
```
However, the deposit fee is not credited to anyone, leading to permanent lockups of deposit fees in the relevant depositor contracts (StakingRewards and ConvexStakingWrapper for now).

 [H-08] MasterChef.sol Users won't be able to receive the concur rewards

Submitted by WatchPug, also found by hickuphh3 and leastwood
According to:
README
Implementation of deposit(): /contracts/MasterChef.sol#L157-L180
MasterChef is only recording the deposited amount in the states, it's not actually holding the depositToken.
depositToken won't be transferred from _msgSender() to the MasterChef contract.
Therefore, in updatePool() L140 lpSupply = pool.depositToken.balanceOf(address(this)) will always be 0. And the updatePool() will be returned at L147.
  [H-09] deposit in ConvexStakingWrapper will most certainly revert

Submitted by wuwe1, also found by WatchPug
ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L94-L99
        address mainPool = IRewardStaking(convexBooster)
            .poolInfo(_pid)
            .crvRewards;
        if (rewards[_pid].length == 0) {
            pids[IRewardStaking(convexBooster).poolInfo(_pid).lptoken] = _pid;
            convexPool[_pid] = mainPool;

convexPool[_pid] is set to IRewardStaking(convexBooster).poolInfo(_pid).crvRewards;
crvRewards is a BaseRewardPool like this one: https://etherscan.io/address/0x8B55351ea358e5Eda371575B031ee24F462d503e#code.
BaseRewardPool does not implement poolInfo
ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L238
IRewardStaking(convexPool[_pid]).poolInfo(_pid).lptoken

Above line calls poolInfo of crvRewards which causes revert.
  [M-02] Unconstrained fee

Submitted by Czar102, also found by defsec, Dravee, harleythedog, hickuphh3, and throttle
MasterChef.sol#L86-L101
Token fee in MasterChef can be set to more than 100%, (for example, by accident) causing all deposit calls to fail due to underflow on subtraction when reward is lowered by the fee, thus breaking essential mechanics. Note that after the fee has been set to any value, it cannot be undone. A token cannot be removed, added, or added the second time. Thus, mistakenly (or deliberately, maliciously) added fee that is larger than 100% will make the contract impossible to recover from not being able to use the token.
  [M-20] MasterChef.updatePool() Fails To Update Reward Variables If block.number >= endBlock

Submitted by leastwood, also found by CertoraInc, csanuragjain, Czar102, hickuphh3, kirk-baird, and WatchPug
The updatePool function intends to calculate the accumulated Concur rewards by tracking the number of blocks passed since the last update to correctly determine how many Concur tokens to distribute to each share. The reward distribution has a start and end block which dictates the timeframe by which rewards will be distributed to the underlying pool.
If a pool has not recently updated itself and has reached the block.number >= endBlock statement in updatePool, then any rewards that it would normally be entitled to prior to reaching endBlock will not be attributed to the pool. Therefore, once rewards are no longer being distributed, pools who had not recently called updatePool before reaching endBlock are at a disadvantage as compared to more active pools.

    ""In `consult`, the Chainlink price (`int256`) is multiplied by `10**10`. Given Chainlink USD feeds typically have 8 decimals, this seems to scale the price to 18 decimals. Is this assumption correct and intended?"",

#### **[H-01] Wrong reward token calculation in MasterChef contract**

**Report Description**:
When adding a new token pool for staking in the MasterChef contract, the function `add()` updates `totalPoints` but fails to update the allocation points of existing pools. This oversight causes old pools to lose their share during the next update, leading to incorrect user rewards (always smaller than expected).

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of incorrect reward token calculation in the MasterChef contract. The problem of outdated allocation points and its impact on user rewards is entirely missed.

---

#### **[H-02] Masterchef: Improper handling of deposit fee**

**Report Description**:
If a pool’s deposit fee is non-zero, it is subtracted from the user’s deposited amount but is not credited to anyone. This results in permanent lockups of deposit fees in the relevant depositor contracts (e.g., StakingRewards and ConvexStakingWrapper).

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of improper handling of deposit fees in the MasterChef contract. The problem of uncredited deposit fees and their permanent lockup is entirely missed.

---

#### **[H-08] MasterChef.sol Users won't be able to receive the concur rewards**

**Report Description**:
The `deposit()` function in MasterChef records the deposited amount but does not transfer the `depositToken` from the user to the contract. As a result, `lpSupply` in `updatePool()` will always be `0`, causing the function to return early and preventing users from receiving rewards.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of missing token transfers in the MasterChef contract. The problem of `lpSupply` being `0` and its impact on reward distribution is entirely missed.

---

#### **[H-09] deposit in ConvexStakingWrapper will most certainly revert**

**Report Description**:
The `ConvexStakingWrapper` contract incorrectly assumes that `BaseRewardPool` implements the `poolInfo` function, which it does not. This causes a revert when `poolInfo` is called, making the `deposit` function unusable.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of incorrect function assumptions in the `ConvexStakingWrapper` contract. The problem of reverting due to missing `poolInfo` implementation is entirely missed.

---

#### **[M-02] Unconstrained fee**

**Report Description**:
The `MasterChef` contract allows the deposit fee to be set to more than 100%, causing all `deposit` calls to fail due to underflow. This issue cannot be fixed as tokens cannot be removed or re-added, making the contract permanently unusable for the affected token.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of unconstrained fees in the MasterChef contract. The problem of underflow due to excessive fees and its impact on contract usability is entirely missed.

---

#### **[M-20] MasterChef.updatePool() Fails To Update Reward Variables If block.number >= endBlock**

**Report Description**:
The `updatePool` function fails to update reward variables if `block.number >= endBlock`. This causes pools that have not recently updated to miss out on rewards they would have been entitled to before reaching `endBlock`.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of missed reward updates in the MasterChef contract. The problem of outdated reward variables and its impact on reward distribution is entirely missed.

Shelter.sol#L52-L57
tl;dr Anyone who can call `withdraw` to withdraw their own funds can call it repeatedly to withdraw the funds of others. withdraw should only succeed if the user hasn't withdrawn the token already.
The shelter can be used for users to withdraw funds in the event of an emergency. The withdraw function allows callers to withdraw tokens based on the tokens they have deposited into the shelter client: ConvexStakingWrapper. However, withdraw does not check if a user has already withdrawn their tokens. Thus a user that can withdraw tokens, can call withdraw repeatedly to steal the tokens of others.
  [H-07] Shelter claimed mapping is set with _to address and not msg.sender

Function `withdraw()`, claimed[_token][_to] 
Any user can withdraw all the funds from the shelter. This is done by calling withdraw repeatedly until all funds are drained. You only need to have a small share.
Even if the claimed mapping was checked, there would still be a vulnerability. This is because the claimed mapping is updated with the _to address, not the msg.sender address.

Submitted by pauliax
Shelter.sol#L34 Shelter.sol#L54
Function donate in Shelter shouldn't allow new deposits after the grace period ends, when the claim period begins. Otherwise, it will be possible to increase savedTokens[_token], and thus new user claim amounts will increase after some users might already have withdrawn their shares.

Submitted by cmichel, also found by Dravee, IllIllI, and Ruhum
Shelter.sol#L34
The Sheler.donate function transferFroms _amount and adds the entire _amount to savedTokens[_token]. But the actual received token amount from the transfer can be less for fee-on-transfer tokens.
The last person to withdraw will not be able to as withdraw uses a share computation for the entire savedTokens[_token] amount. The calculated amount will then be higher than the actual contract balance.
function donate(IERC20 _token, uint256 _amount) external {
    require(activated[_token] != 0, ""!activated"");
    savedTokens[_token] += _amount;
    // @audit fee-on-transfer. then fails for last person in `withdraw`

    // @audit percentage on storage var, not on actual balance

However, if the owner decides to deactivate the shelter before the grace period has passed, all LP tokens are transferred back to the ConvexStakingWrapper.sol contract. Donated tokens are also sent back to the contract. As a result, these tokens do not actually belong to any user and will effectively be lost in the contract.

}",49.90810394287109,3646.0,8.0,"### **[H-03] Repeated Calls to Shelter.withdraw Can Drain All Funds in Shelter**

**Report Description**:
The `withdraw` function in `Shelter.sol` allows users to withdraw tokens based on their deposited amount. However, it does not check if a user has already withdrawn their tokens. This oversight enables a user to repeatedly call `withdraw` to drain all funds from the shelter, including those belonging to other users. Additionally, the `claimed` mapping is updated with the `_to` address instead of `msg.sender`, further exacerbating the vulnerability.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of repeated withdrawals or the incorrect updating of the `claimed` mapping. The provided findings focus on access control and input validation, which are unrelated to the specific vulnerability described in the issue report.

---

### **[H-07] Shelter claimed mapping is set with _to address and not msg.sender**

**Report Description**:
The `claimed` mapping in the `withdraw` function is updated with the `_to` address instead of `msg.sender`. This allows any user to withdraw all funds from the shelter by repeatedly calling `withdraw` until all funds are drained. Even if the `claimed` mapping were checked, the vulnerability would persist due to this incorrect mapping update.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of the `claimed` mapping being updated with the wrong address. The findings in the response list are unrelated to this specific vulnerability.

---

### **[M-01] Deposits after the grace period should not be allowed**

**Report Description**:
The `donate` function in `Shelter.sol` allows new deposits even after the grace period ends, when the claim period begins. This can lead to an increase in `savedTokens[_token]`, which in turn increases the claim amounts for new users. This is problematic because some users may have already withdrawn their shares, leading to discrepancies in token distribution.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of allowing deposits after the grace period. The findings in the response list are unrelated to this specific vulnerability.

---

### **[M-07] Fee-on-transfer token donations in Shelter break withdrawals**

**Report Description**:
The `donate` function in `Shelter.sol` adds the entire `_amount` to `savedTokens[_token]` without accounting for fee-on-transfer tokens. This can result in `savedTokens[_token]` being higher than the actual contract balance. Consequently, the last person to withdraw may not be able to do so because the calculated withdrawal amount exceeds the actual balance.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of fee-on-transfer tokens causing discrepancies in `savedTokens[_token]`. The findings in the response list are unrelated to this specific vulnerability.

---

### **[M-08] Donated Tokens Cannot Be Recovered If A Shelter Is Deactivated**

**Report Description**:
When the shelter is deactivated before the grace period ends, all LP tokens, including donated tokens, are transferred back to the `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol` contract. Since these donated tokens do not belong to any user, they are effectively lost in the contract, leading to potential financial loss.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of donated tokens being lost when the shelter is deactivated. The findings in the response list are unrelated to this specific vulnerability.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:
- **[H-03] Repeated Calls to Shelter.withdraw Can Drain All Funds in Shelter**

function `_calcRewardIntegral()`   [H-10] ConvexStakingWrapper.exitShelter() Will Lock LP Tokens, Preventing Users From Withdrawing

Submitted by leastwood
The shelter mechanism provides emergency functionality in an effort to protect users' funds. The enterShelter function will withdraw all LP tokens from the pool, transfer them to the shelter contract and activate the shelter for the target LP token. Conversely, the exitShelter function will deactivate the shelter and transfer all LP tokens back to the ConvexStakingWrapper.sol contract.
Unfortunately, LP tokens aren't restaked in the pool, causing LP tokens to be stuck within the contract. Users will be unable to withdraw their LP tokens as the withdraw function attempts to withdrawAndUnwrap LP tokens from the staking pool. As a result, this function will always revert due to insufficient staked balance. If other users decide to deposit their LP tokens, then these tokens can be swiped by users who have had their LP tokens locked in the contract.
This guarantees poor UX for the protocol and will most definitely lead to LP token loss.
  [H-11] ConvexStakingWrapper._calcRewardIntegral() Can Be Manipulated To Steal Tokens From Other Pools

Submitted by leastwood, also found by cmichel and kirk-baird
The ConvexStakingWrapper.sol implementation makes several modifications to the original design. One of the key changes is the ability to add multiple pools into the wrapper contract, where each pool is represented by a unique _pid. By doing this, we are able to aggregate pools and their LP tokens to simplify the token distribution process.
However, the interdependence between pools introduces new problems. Because the original implementation uses the contract's reward token balance to track newly claimed tokens, it is possible for a malicious user to abuse the unguarded getReward function to maximise the profit they are able to generate. By calling getReward on multiple pools with the same reward token (i.e. cvx), users are able to siphon rewards from other pools. This inevitably leads to certain loss of rewards for users who have deposited LP tokens into these victim pools. As crv and cvx are reward tokens by default, it is very likely that someone will want to exploit this issue.
  [M-11] ConvexStakingWrapper.enterShelter() May Erroneously Overwrite amountInShelter Leading To Locked Tokens

Submitted by leastwood
The shelter mechanism provides emergency functionality in an effort to protect users' funds. The enterShelter function will withdraw all LP tokens from the pool, transfer them to the shelter contract and activate the shelter for the target LP token. If this function is called again on the same LP token, the amountInShelter value is overwritten, potentially by the zero amount. As a result its possible that the shelter is put in a state where no users can withdraw from it or only a select few users with a finite number of shares are able to. Once the shelter has passed its grace period, these tokens may forever be locked in the shelter contract.
Proof of Concept

    for(uint256 i = 0; i<_pids.length; i++){

        pool.withdrawAndUnwrap(amount, false);
        IERC20 lpToken = IERC20(
            pool.poolInfo(_pids[i]).lptoken

        amountInShelter[lpToken] = amount;
        lpToken.safeTransfer(address(shelter), amount);
        shelter.activate(lpToken);
    }

  [M-14] Owner can steal Concur rewards

Submitted by Czar102
MasterChef.sol#L78-L80 MasterChef.sol#L157-L180
Owner can steal Concur rewards by adding a depositor and inflating other depositors' assigned balance of the token within the contract. Thus, the owner-managed depositor can get most (all but one wei) of the created tokens.
  [M-15] Owner can lock tokens in MasterChef

Submitted by Czar102, also found by csanuragjain and Jujic
MasterChef.sol#L82-L84
Owner can remove a depositor. Since only depositors can deposit and withdraw, the owner may add a contract to the whitelist, let users deposit in the contract and remove the depositor from the whitelist. Depositor's reward cannot be withdrawn then. And takes a share of Concur tokens that will not be distributed.
  [M-16] Rewards get diluted because totalAllocPoint can only increase.

Submitted by throttle
MasterChef.sol
There is no functionality for removing pools/setting pool's allocPoints. Therefore totalAllocPoint only increases and rewards for pool decreases.

}",227.3331582546234,4105.0,33.0,"### **[H-04] ConvexStakingWrapper, StakingRewards Wrong implementation will send concur rewards to the wrong receiver**

**Report Description**:
The `ConvexStakingWrapper` and `StakingRewards` contracts use `masterChef.deposit()` and `masterChef.withdraw()`, which take `_msgSender()` as the user address. However, `_msgSender()` is the address of `ConvexStakingWrapper` and `StakingRewards`, not the actual user. This misimplementation can lead to `concur` rewards being sent to the wrong receiver, causing incorrect reward distribution and potential loss of funds for users.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The problem involves incorrect reward distribution due to the misuse of `_msgSender()` in `masterChef.deposit()` and `masterChef.withdraw()`, which is not covered in the response list.

---

### **[H-06] ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#_calcRewardIntegral Wrong implementation can disrupt rewards calculation and distribution**

**Report Description**:
The `_calcRewardIntegral` function in `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol` has a flawed implementation that can disrupt rewards calculation and distribution. This could lead to incorrect reward allocation, potential loss of funds, or exploitation by malicious users.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential Reentrancy Vulnerability in `_calcRewardIntegral`""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies a reentrancy vulnerability in `_calcRewardIntegral`, which is a valid concern. However, it does not address the broader issue of incorrect rewards calculation and distribution, which is the core problem described in the issue report.

---

### **[H-10] ConvexStakingWrapper.exitShelter() Will Lock LP Tokens, Preventing Users From Withdrawing**

**Report Description**:
The `exitShelter` function in `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol` does not restake LP tokens back into the pool after transferring them from the shelter contract. This oversight causes LP tokens to be stuck in the contract, preventing users from withdrawing their funds. If other users deposit LP tokens, these tokens can be swiped by users whose tokens are locked, leading to poor UX and potential loss of funds.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The problem involves LP tokens being locked due to the failure to restake them after exiting the shelter, which is not covered in the response list.

---

### **[H-11] ConvexStakingWrapper._calcRewardIntegral() Can Be Manipulated To Steal Tokens From Other Pools**

**Report Description**:
The `_calcRewardIntegral` function in `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol` can be manipulated by malicious users to siphon rewards from other pools. This is possible because the function uses the contract's reward token balance to track newly claimed tokens, and the `getReward` function is unguarded. This can lead to certain loss of rewards for users who have deposited LP tokens into victim pools.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential Reentrancy Vulnerability in `_calcRewardIntegral`""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies a reentrancy vulnerability in `_calcRewardIntegral`, which is related to the issue. However, it does not address the specific manipulation of reward token balances to steal tokens from other pools, which is the core problem described in the issue report.

---

### **[M-11] ConvexStakingWrapper.enterShelter() May Erroneously Overwrite amountInShelter Leading To Locked Tokens**

**Report Description**:
The `enterShelter` function in `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol` overwrites the `amountInShelter` value when called multiple times on the same LP token. This can lead to the shelter being in a state where no users can withdraw their tokens or only a select few users can. Once the shelter has passed its grace period, these tokens may forever be locked in the shelter contract.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The problem involves the overwriting of `amountInShelter` leading to locked tokens, which is not covered in the response list.

---

### **[M-14] Owner can steal Concur rewards**

**Report Description**:
The owner of the `MasterChef` contract can steal `Concur` rewards by adding a depositor and inflating other depositors' assigned balance of the token within the contract. This allows the owner-managed depositor to get most (all but one wei) of the created tokens.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The problem involves the owner's ability to manipulate depositor balances to steal rewards, which is not covered in the response list.

---

### **[M-15] Owner can lock tokens in MasterChef**

**Report Description**:
The owner of the `MasterChef` contract can remove a depositor from the whitelist, preventing users from withdrawing their tokens. This can lead to tokens being locked in the contract, and the owner can take a share of `Concur` tokens that will not be distributed.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The problem involves the owner's ability to lock tokens by removing depositors from the whitelist, which is not covered in the response list.

---

### **[M-16] Rewards get diluted because totalAllocPoint can only increase.**

**Report Description**:
The `MasterChef` contract does not have functionality for removing pools or setting pool's `allocPoints`. As a result, `totalAllocPoint` only increases, leading to a dilution of rewards for existing pools.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The problem involves the dilution of rewards due to the inability to decrease `totalAllocPoint`, which is not covered in the response list.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:
- **[H-06] ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#_calcRewardIntegral Wrong implementation can disrupt rewards calculation and distribution**
- **[H-11] ConvexStakingWrapper._calcRewardIntegral() Can Be Manipulated To Steal Tokens From Other Pools**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:
- **[H-04] ConvexStakingWrapper, StakingRewards Wrong implementation will send concur rewards to the wrong receiver**
- **[H-10] ConvexStakingWrapper.exitShelter() Will Lock LP Tokens, Preventing Users From Withdrawing**
- **[M-11] ConvexStakingWrapper.enterShelter() May Erroneously Overwrite amountInShelter Leading To Locked Tokens**
- **[M-14] Owner can steal Concur rewards**
- **[M-15] Owner can lock tokens in MasterChef**
- **[M-16] Rewards get diluted because totalAllocPoint can only increase.**

The response list partially addresses two high-severity issues but misses several critical vulnerabilities and risks described in the issue report. The gaps include incorrect reward distribution, locked tokens, owner manipulation, and reward dilution, which are not covered in the response list.","```

StakingRewards.sol#L154-L158
    uint256 balance = rewardsToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    require(
        rewardRate <= balance / rewardsDuration,
        ""Provided reward too high""
    );

In the current implementation, the contract only checks if balanceOf rewardsToken is greater than or equal to the future rewards.
However, under normal circumstances, since users can not withdraw all their rewards in time, the balance in the contract contains rewards that belong to the users but have not been withdrawn yet. This means the current checks can not be sufficient enough to make sure the contract has enough amount of rewardsToken.
As a result, if the rewardsDistribution mistakenly notifyRewardAmount with a larger amount, the contract may end up in a wrong state that makes some users unable to claim their rewards.
  [M-13] StakingRewards.recoverERC20 allows owner to rug the rewardsToken

Submitted by Alex the Entreprenerd, also found by pauliax
StakingRewards.sol#L166
StakingRewards.recoverERC20 rightfully checks against the stakingToken being sweeped away. However, there's no check against the rewardsToken which over time will sit in this contract.
This is the case of an admin privilege, which allows the owner to sweep the rewards tokens, perhaps as a way to rug depositors.
Proof of Concept

Calling StakingRewards.recoverERC20(rewardsToken, rewardsToken.balanceOf(this)) enables the owner to sweep the token.
Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add an additional check

            tokenAddress != address(rewardsToken),

#### **[H-04] ConvexStakingWrapper, StakingRewards Wrong implementation will send concur rewards to the wrong receiver**

**Report Description**:  
The `ConvexStakingWrapper` and `StakingRewards` contracts use `masterChef.deposit()` and `masterChef.withdraw()`, which take `_msgSender()` as the user address. However, `_msgSender()` is the address of `ConvexStakingWrapper` and `StakingRewards`, not the actual user. This misimplementation could result in `concur` rewards being sent to the wrong receiver, leading to incorrect reward distribution and potential loss of funds for users.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Inconsistent reward distribution with masterChef""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue of inconsistent reward distribution due to the interaction with the `MasterChef` contract. It highlights the risk of misalignment between the reward logic of `StakingRewards` and `MasterChef`, which aligns with the issue described in the report.

---

#### **[M-06] StakingRewards.sol recoverERC20() can be used as a backdoor by the owner to retrieve rewardsToken**

**Report Description**:  
The `recoverERC20()` function in `StakingRewards.sol` allows the owner to retrieve ERC20 tokens, but it only checks against the `stakingToken`. There is no check to prevent the owner from withdrawing the `rewardsToken`, which could be used as a backdoor to rug depositors by sweeping the rewards tokens.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential misuse of `recoverERC20` function.""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the issue of the `recoverERC20` function lacking checks for the `rewardsToken`. However, it does not explicitly mention the risk of the owner rugging depositors, which is a critical aspect of the issue. The response focuses on the potential disruption of reward distribution rather than the malicious intent.

---

#### **[M-09] StakingRewards.sol#notifyRewardAmount() Improper reward balance checks can make some users unable to withdraw their rewards**

**Report Description**:  
The `notifyRewardAmount()` function checks if the `rewardRate` is less than or equal to the balance of `rewardsToken` divided by `rewardsDuration`. However, the balance includes rewards that belong to users but have not been withdrawn yet. This means the check is insufficient, and if `rewardsDistribution` mistakenly notifies a larger amount, some users may be unable to claim their rewards.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Insufficient balance check in `notifyRewardAmount` function""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue of insufficient balance checks in the `notifyRewardAmount` function. It explains the risk of low reward rates due to large `rewardsDuration`, which aligns with the issue described in the report.

---

#### **[M-13] StakingRewards.recoverERC20 allows owner to rug the rewardsToken**

**Report Description**:  
The `recoverERC20()` function in `StakingRewards.sol` checks against the `stakingToken` but does not prevent the owner from withdrawing the `rewardsToken`. This allows the owner to rug depositors by sweeping the rewards tokens, which is a critical admin privilege vulnerability.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential for Griefing Attack on `recoverERC20`""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the issue of the owner potentially withdrawing ERC20 tokens, but it does not explicitly mention the risk of rugging depositors by sweeping the `rewardsToken`. The response focuses on the potential disruption of the rewards system rather than the malicious intent.

- **[M-06] StakingRewards.sol recoverERC20() can be used as a backdoor by the owner to retrieve rewardsToken**
- **[M-13] StakingRewards.recoverERC20 allows owner to rug the rewardsToken**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:

- *None*

---

### **Conclusion**  
The response list covers most of the issues in the issue report, but some responses are **partially correct** as they miss critical details, such as the risk of rugging depositors in the `recoverERC20` function. Overall, the response list is comprehensive but could be improved by explicitly addressing the malicious intent in certain vulnerabilities.","```
1. Inconsistent reward distribution with masterChef
2. Insufficient balance check in `notifyRewardAmount` function
```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the ranks of the true positives in the ranked list of predictions**:
   - ""Inconsistent reward distribution with masterChef"" appears at rank **5**.
   - ""Insufficient balance check in `notifyRewardAmount` function"" appears at rank **13**.

2. **Calculate the precision at each rank**:
   - For rank 5: \( P@5 = \frac{1}{5} = 0.2 \)
   - For rank 13: \( P@13 = \frac{2}{13} \approx 0.1538 \)

3. **Compute the Average Precision (AP)**:
   \[
   AP = \frac{0.2 + 0.1538}{2} \approx 0.1769
   \]

**Average Precision (AP)**: **0.1769**"

Submitted by Alex the Entreprenerd, also found by gzeon, IllIllI, and leastwood
USDMPegRecovery.sol#L90 USDMPegRecovery.sol#L110 USDMPegRecovery.sol#L73 USDMPegRecovery.sol#L84
In USDMPegRecovery deposit and withdraw allow for direct deposits of a specific token (3crv or usdm).
The balances are directly changed and tracked in storage.
provide seems to be using the real balances (not the ones store) to provide liquidity. Because of how curve works, you'll be able (first deposit) to provide exactly matching liquidity. But after (even just 1 or) multiple swaps, the pool will be slightly imbalanced, adding or removing liquidity at that point will drastically change the balances in the contract from the ones tracked in storage.
Eventually users won't be able to withdraw the exact amounts they deposited.
This will culminate with real balances not matching user deposits, sometimes to user advantage and other times to user disadvantage, ultimately to the protocol dismay.
  [M-03] USDMPegRecovery.sol#withdraw() withdraw may often fail

Submitted by WatchPug
Per the doc:
USDM deposits are locked based on the KPI’s from carrot.eth.
3Crv deposits are not locked.
USDMPegRecovery.sol#L110-L128
function withdraw(Liquidity calldata _withdrawal) external {
        Liquidity memory total = totalLiquidity;
        Liquidity memory user = userLiquidity[msg.sender];

            require(unlockable, ""!unlock usdm"");
            usdm.safeTransfer(msg.sender, uint256(_withdrawal.usdm));
            total.usdm -= _withdrawal.usdm;
            user.usdm -= _withdrawal.usdm;
        }

        if(_withdrawal.pool3 > 0) {
            pool3.safeTransfer(msg.sender, uint256(_withdrawal.pool3));

        totalLiquidity = total;
        userLiquidity[msg.sender] = user;
        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, _withdrawal);
    }

However, because the withdraw() function takes funds from the balance of the contract, once the majority of the funds are added to the curve pool via provide(). The withdraw() may often fail due to insufficient funds in the balance.
  [M-04] USDMPegRecovery.sol#provide() Improper design/implementation make it often unable to add liquidity to the usdm3crv pool

Submitted by WatchPug
USDMPegRecovery.sol#L73-L82
function provide(uint256 _minimumLP) external onlyGuardian {
    require(usdm.balanceOf(address(this)) >= totalLiquidity.usdm, ""<liquidity"");
    // truncate amounts under step
    uint256 addingLiquidity = (usdm.balanceOf(address(this)) / step) * step;

    pool3.approve(address(usdm3crv), addingLiquidity);
    usdm3crv.add_liquidity(amounts, _minimumLP);
}

In the current implementation of USDMPegRecovery.sol#provide(), addingLiquidity is calculated solely based on usdm balance (truncate at a step of 250k), and it always uses the same amount of 3pool tokens to add_liquidity with.
Based on other functions of the contract, the balance of usdm can usually be more than the pool3 balance, in that case, usdm3crv.add_liquidity() will fail.
  [M-05] USDM locked unless guardian remove liquidity

Submitted by gzeon
In README.me:
USDM deposits are locked based on the KPI’s from carrot.eth
However, USDM deposits are also locked until guardian remove liquidity because there are no mechanism to remove deposited USDM in withdraw.
USDMPegRecovery.sol#L90
  [M-12] USDMPegRecovery.provide() Will Fail If There Is An Excess Of usdm Tokens

Submitted by leastwood
The provide function does not take a _steps argument and will instead calculate addingLiquidity by truncating amounts under step. As a result, if there is an excess of usdm such that the truncated amount exceeds the contract's pool3 truncated balance, then the function will revert due to insufficient pool3 collateral.
This will prevent guardians from effectively providing liquidity whenever tokens are available. Consider the following example:
The contract has 500000e18 usdm tokens and 250000e18 pool3 tokens.
addingLiquidity will be calculated as 500000e18 / 250000e18 * 250000e18.
The function will attempt to add 500000e18 usdm and pool3 tokens in which there are insufficient pool3 tokens in the contract. As a result, it will revert even though there is an abundance of tokens that satisfy the step amount.

**Report Description**:  
The `USDMPegRecovery` contract allows direct deposits of `3crv` or `usdm` tokens, and balances are tracked in storage. However, the `provide` function uses real balances (not the stored ones) to add liquidity to the Curve pool. Due to the nature of Curve pools, swaps can cause imbalances, leading to discrepancies between the real balances and the stored balances. This can result in users being unable to withdraw the exact amounts they deposited, potentially locking funds or causing losses to the protocol.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of discrepancies between real balances and stored balances in the `USDMPegRecovery` contract. This is a critical oversight, as it directly impacts the contract's ability to manage user funds accurately and securely.

### **[M-03] USDMPegRecovery.sol#withdraw() Withdraw May Often Fail**

**Report Description**:  
The `withdraw` function in `USDMPegRecovery.sol` transfers funds from the contract's balance. However, once most funds are added to the Curve pool via the `provide` function, the contract's balance may be insufficient to fulfill withdrawal requests, causing the `withdraw` function to fail frequently.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of insufficient contract balances causing withdrawal failures. This is a significant operational risk, as users may be unable to access their funds when needed.

---

### **[M-04] USDMPegRecovery.sol#provide() Improper Design/Implementation Make It Often Unable to Add Liquidity to the usdm3crv Pool**

**Report Description**:  
The `provide` function calculates `addingLiquidity` based solely on the `usdm` balance, truncating it at a step of 250k. It then attempts to add an equal amount of `pool3` tokens to the Curve pool. If the `pool3` balance is insufficient, the function will fail, preventing liquidity from being added even when tokens are available.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential DoS in provide() if usdm balance is very small""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies a related issue where `addingLiquidity` could be zero if the `usdm` balance is too small. However, it does not address the core problem of the function failing due to insufficient `pool3` tokens, which is a more significant issue.

---

### **[M-05] USDM Locked Unless Guardian Removes Liquidity**

**Report Description**:  
The `USDMPegRecovery` contract locks `USDM` deposits based on KPIs from `carrot.eth`. However, there is no mechanism to remove deposited `USDM` in the `withdraw` function unless the guardian removes liquidity from the Curve pool. This could lead to `USDM` being locked indefinitely.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of `USDM` being locked due to the lack of a mechanism to remove liquidity. This is a critical design flaw that could prevent users from accessing their funds.

---

### **[M-12] USDMPegRecovery.provide() Will Fail If There Is An Excess of usdm Tokens**

**Report Description**:  
The `provide` function calculates `addingLiquidity` by truncating the `usdm` balance under a step of 250k. If the truncated amount exceeds the contract's `pool3` balance, the function will revert due to insufficient `pool3` tokens, preventing liquidity from being added even when tokens are available.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential DoS in provide() if usdm balance is very small""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies a related issue where `addingLiquidity` could be zero if the `usdm` balance is too small. However, it does not address the core problem of the function failing due to insufficient `pool3` tokens, which is a more significant issue.
