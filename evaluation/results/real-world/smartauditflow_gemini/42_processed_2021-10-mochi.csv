}",3028,374,"[H-01] Vault fails to track debt correctly that leads to bad debt
Arithmetic issue in function `borrow`

It's similar to the issue ""misuse amount as increasing debt in the vault contract"". Similar issue in a different place that leads to different exploit patterns and severity.
When users borrow usdm from a vault, the debt increases by the amount * 1.005.
    uint256 increasingDebt = (_amount * 1005) / 1000;

However, when the contract records the total debt it uses _amount instead of increasingDebt.
details[_id].debtIndex =
    (details[_id].debtIndex * (totalDebt)) /
    (details[_id].debt + _amount);
details[_id].debt = totalDebt;
details[_id].status = Status.Active;
debts += _amount;
 [H-05] debts calculation is not accurate

Submitted by gpersoon
Impact

The value of the global variable `debts` in the contract MochiVault.sol is calculated in an inconsistent way.
In the function borrow() the variable debts is increased with a value excluding the fee. However in repay() and liquidate() it is decreased with the same value as details\[\_id].debt is decreased, which is including the fee.
This would mean that debts will end up in a negative value when all debts are repay-ed. Luckily the function repay() prevents this from happening.
In the meantime the value of debts isn't accurate. This value is used directly or indirectly in:
utilizationRatio(), stabilityFee() calculateFeeIndex() of MochiProfileV0.sol
liveDebtIndex(), accrueDebt(), currentDebt() of MochiVault.sol
 [H-08] Anyone can extend withdraw wait period by depositing zero collateral

In MochiVault.sol, the `deposit` function allows anyone to deposit collateral into any position. A malicious user can call this function with amount = 0, which would reset the amount of time the owner has to wait before they can withdraw their collateral from their position. This is especially troublesome with longer delays, as a malicious user would only have to spend a little gas to lock out all other users from being able to withdraw from their positions, compromising the functionality of the contract altogether.

[M-04] Unchecked ERC20 transfer calls

Submitted by loop, also found by cmichel, defsec, gzeon, leastwood, nikitastupin, pants, and WatchPug
ERC20 transfer and transferFrom calls normally return true on a succesful transfer. In DutchAuctionLiquidator the call asset.transfer(msg.sender, _collateral); is made. asset refers to whichever ERC20 asset is used for the vault of that auction. If asset is an ERC20 token which does not comply with the EIP-20 standard it might return false on a failed transaction rather than revert. In this case it would count as a valid transaction even though it is not. If a vault would be making use of USDT the transfer call would always revert as USDT returns void on transfers.
There are a few more transfer(From) calls which are unchecked, these are however all on a predetermined asset (mochi, usdM and crv) and unlikely to cause problems.
 [M-10] griefing attack to block withdraws

Every time you deposit some assets in the vault (via deposit() of MochiVault.sol) then ""lastDeposit[_id]"" is set to block.timestamp. The modifier wait() checks this value and makes sure you cannot withdraw for ""delay()"" blocks. The default value for delay() is 3 minutes.
Knowing this delay you can do a griefing attack: On chains with low gas fees: every 3 minutes deposit a tiny amount for a specific NFT-id (which has a large amount of assets). On chains with high gas fees: monitor the mempool for a withdraw() transaction and frontrun it with a deposit()

---

#### **[H-01] Vault fails to track debt correctly that leads to bad debt**

**Report Description**:  
The `borrow` function in the vault contract incorrectly calculates the debt. When users borrow `usdm`, the debt increases by `_amount * 1.005`. However, the total debt is recorded using `_amount` instead of `increasingDebt`. This inconsistency leads to incorrect debt tracking, potentially causing bad debt and financial discrepancies.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Incorrect calculation of `details[_id].debtIndex` in borrow function.""**

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue with the incorrect calculation of `details[_id].debtIndex` in the `borrow` function. It correctly explains that the debt index should be calculated based on `increasingDebt` rather than `_amount`, which aligns with the reported issue.

---

#### **[H-05] `debts` calculation is not accurate**

**Report Description**:  
The global variable `debts` in `MochiVault.sol` is calculated inconsistently. In the `borrow` function, `debts` is increased by `_amount` excluding the fee, while in `repay` and `liquidate`, it is decreased by the value including the fee. This inconsistency could lead to `debts` becoming negative when all debts are repaid, although the `repay` function prevents this. The inaccurate `debts` value affects multiple functions, including `utilizationRatio`, `stabilityFee`, and `calculateFeeIndex`.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Debt and Deposit accounting inconsistencies in `repay`.""**

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the issue with debt accounting in the `repay` function but focuses on the underflow risk rather than the inconsistency between `borrow`, `repay`, and `liquidate`. It misses the broader impact of the inaccurate `debts` value on other functions.

---

#### **[H-08] Anyone can extend withdraw wait period by depositing zero collateral**

**Report Description**:  
The `deposit` function in `MochiVault.sol` allows anyone to deposit collateral into any position, even with `amount = 0`. This resets the `lastDeposit[_id]` timestamp, extending the wait period for withdrawals. A malicious user could exploit this to lock out other users from withdrawing their collateral, especially in contracts with longer delays.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Missed Issue**. The response list does not address this issue, which is a significant vulnerability that could compromise the functionality of the contract.

---

#### **[M-04] Unchecked ERC20 transfer calls**

**Report Description**:  
In `DutchAuctionLiquidator`, the `asset.transfer(msg.sender, _collateral)` call is unchecked. If `asset` is a non-compliant ERC20 token (e.g., USDT), it may return `false` on failure instead of reverting, leading to silent failures. This could result in incorrect accounting or loss of funds.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Inconsistent Use of CheapERC20.""**

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the issue with unchecked ERC20 transfers but focuses on the use of `CheapTransfer` and `CheapTransferFrom` in `MochiVault.sol`. It does not specifically address the vulnerability in `DutchAuctionLiquidator`.

---

#### **[M-10] Griefing attack to block withdraws**

**Report Description**:  
The `deposit` function in `MochiVault.sol` updates `lastDeposit[_id]` to `block.timestamp`, which is checked by the `wait` modifier to enforce a withdrawal delay. A malicious user can exploit this by depositing a tiny amount every 3 minutes (or frontrunning `withdraw` transactions) to block withdrawals, especially on chains with low gas fees.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Missed Issue**. The response list does not address this issue, which is a significant griefing attack vector.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:

- **[H-01] Vault fails to track debt correctly that leads to bad debt**

**Partially Correct Matches**:

- **[H-05] `debts` calculation is not accurate**
- **[M-04] Unchecked ERC20 transfer calls**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:

- **[H-08] Anyone can extend withdraw wait period by depositing zero collateral**
- **[M-10] Griefing attack to block withdraws**

---

### **Conclusion**

The response list covers some of the issues but misses critical vulnerabilities like **[H-08]** and **[M-10]**. Additionally, some matches are only partially correct, as they do not fully address the reported issues. The response list should be expanded to include these missed issues and provide more detailed solutions for partially correct matches.","```
1. Incorrect calculation of `details[_id].debtIndex` in borrow function.
```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the rank of the true positive**:
   - The true positive is: ""Incorrect calculation of `details[_id].debtIndex` in borrow function.""
   - This issue appears at **rank 3** in the ranked list of predictions.

2. **Calculate the precision at rank 3 (P@3)**:
   - Precision at rank 3 is calculated as the number of true positives up to rank 3 divided by 3.
   - Since there is only one true positive up to rank 3, \( P@3 = \frac{1}{3} \).

3. **Compute the Average Precision (AP)**:
   - AP is the average of the precision values for all true positives.
   - Since there is only one true positive, \( AP = P@3 = \frac{1}{3} \).

**Output**:
```

Submitted by WatchPug
`distributeMochi()` will call _buyMochi() to convert mochiShare to Mochi token and call _shareMochi() to send Mochi to vMochi Vault and veCRV Holders. It wont touch the treasuryShare.
However, in the current implementation, treasuryShare will be reset to 0. This is unexpected and will cause the protocol fee can not be properly accounted for and collected.

```  [H-11] treasuryShare is Overwritten in FeePoolV0._shareMochi()
Function `_shareMochi()`  overwritten `treasuryShare`
The FeePoolV0.sol contract accrues fees upon the liquidation of undercollaterised positions. These fees are split between treasury and vMochi contracts. However, when `distributeMochi()` is called to distribute mochi tokens to veCRV holders, both mochiShare and treasuryShare is flushed from the contract when there are still usdm tokens in the contract.
 [H-12] feePool is vulnerable to sandwich attack.

There's a permissionless function `distributeMochi` in FeePoolV0.sol L55-L62. Since everyone can trigger this function, an attacker can launch a sandwich attack with flashloan to steal the funds.
The devs have mentioned this concern in the comment. An attacker can steal the funds with a flash loan attack.
Attackers can steal all the funds in the pool. I consider this is a high-risk issue.

**Report Description**:  
The `distributeMochi()` function in `FeePoolV0.sol` calls `_buyMochi()` to convert `mochiShare` to Mochi tokens and `_shareMochi()` to distribute Mochi tokens to the vMochi Vault and veCRV holders. However, the `_shareMochi()` function incorrectly resets both `mochiShare` and `treasuryShare` to `0`. This unexpected behavior prevents the protocol fee from being properly accounted for and collected, as `treasuryShare` is flushed even though it should remain untouched.

**Match in Response List**:  
No match found.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of `treasuryShare` being incorrectly reset in the `_shareMochi()` function. This is a critical oversight that directly impacts the protocol's ability to account for and collect fees. The response list focuses on reentrancy vulnerabilities, access control issues, and arithmetic errors but misses this specific flaw.

### **[H-11] treasuryShare is Overwritten in FeePoolV0._shareMochi()**

**Report Description**:  
The `_shareMochi()` function in `FeePoolV0.sol` overwrites `treasuryShare` by resetting it to `0`. This behavior is unexpected and problematic because the contract accrues fees from liquidations, which are split between the treasury and vMochi contracts. Flushing `treasuryShare` when there are still `usdm` tokens in the contract disrupts the intended fee distribution mechanism.

**Match in Response List**:  
No match found.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not mention the issue of `treasuryShare` being overwritten in the `_shareMochi()` function. This is a significant flaw that affects the protocol's fee distribution logic. The response list includes issues like reentrancy, access control, and arithmetic errors but fails to address this specific problem.

---

### **[H-12] FeePool is vulnerable to sandwich attack**

**Report Description**:  
The `distributeMochi()` function in `FeePoolV0.sol` is permissionless, allowing anyone to trigger it. This makes the contract vulnerable to a sandwich attack, where an attacker can use a flash loan to manipulate the price of Mochi tokens and steal funds from the pool. The developers have acknowledged this concern in the comments, but the issue remains unaddressed, posing a high risk to the protocol.

**Match in Response List**:  
No match found.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the sandwich attack vulnerability in the `distributeMochi()` function. This is a high-risk issue that could lead to significant loss of funds. The response list focuses on reentrancy, access control, and arithmetic errors but misses this critical attack vector.

 [H-06] Referrer can drain ReferralFeePoolV0

Submitted by gzeon
Impact

function `claimRewardAsMochi` in ReferralFeePoolV0.sol did not reduce user reward balance, allowing referrer to claim the same reward repeatedly and thus draining the fee pool.

[M-02] regerralFeePool is vulnerable to MEV searcher


`claimRewardAsMochi` in the ReferralFeePoolV0 ignores slippage. This is not a desirable design. There are a lot of MEV searchers in the current network. Swapping assets with no slippage control would get rekted. Please refer to https://github.com/flashbots/pm.
Given the current state of the Ethereum network, users would likely be sandwiched. I consider this is a high-risk issue.

}",135.6070258617401,2839.0,26.0,"### **[H-03] ReferralFeePoolV0.sol#claimRewardAsMochi() Array out of bound exception**

**Report Description**:  
The `claimRewardAsMochi` function in `ReferralFeePoolV0.sol` initializes the `path` array with a length of 2 but attempts to assign a value to `path[2]`, which is out of bounds. This will cause the transaction to revert, preventing the swap from executing as intended. The correct path length should be 3 to accommodate the swap route: `USDM -> WETH -> MOCHI`.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Incorrect Path Length in claimRewardAsMochi Function""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue with the incorrect array length and the resulting out-of-bounds write. It correctly explains the impact, including the potential for transaction failure and unintended behavior, which aligns with the issue report.

---

### **[H-06] Referrer can drain ReferralFeePoolV0**

**Report Description**:  
The `claimRewardAsMochi` function in `ReferralFeePoolV0.sol` does not reduce the user's reward balance after claiming. This allows a referrer to repeatedly claim the same reward, potentially draining the fee pool.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Missing Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the issue with the missing state update (`reward[msg.sender]` not being reset) but does not explicitly mention the risk of repeated claims or draining the fee pool. While the response is technically correct, it misses the broader impact described in the issue report.

---

### **[M-02] ReferralFeePool is vulnerable to MEV searcher**

**Report Description**:  
The `claimRewardAsMochi` function in `ReferralFeePoolV0.sol` ignores slippage control, setting `minAmountOut` to 1. This makes the swap highly susceptible to MEV attacks, such as sandwiching, where users may receive significantly less MOCHI than expected.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Uncontrolled Slippage in Uniswap Swap and Missing Slippage Control""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue with the lack of slippage control and the potential for MEV attacks. It correctly explains the impact, including the risk of users receiving fewer tokens than expected, which aligns with the issue report.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:

- **[H-03] ReferralFeePoolV0.sol#claimRewardAsMochi() Array out of bound exception**
- **[M-02] ReferralFeePool is vulnerable to MEV searcher**

**Partially Correct Matches**:

- **[H-06] Referrer can drain ReferralFeePoolV0**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:

- *None*

---

### **Conclusion**  
The `response_list` provides comprehensive coverage of the issues in the `issue` report, with most matches being **correct**. The only **partially correct** match is for **[H-06]**, where the response identifies the core issue but misses the broader impact of repeated claims and fee pool draining. Overall, the responses are well-aligned with Solidity best practices and security standards.","```
1. Incorrect Path Length in claimRewardAsMochi Function
2. Uncontrolled Slippage in Uniswap Swap and Missing Slippage Control
```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the ranks of the true positives in the ranked list of predictions**:
   - ""Incorrect Path Length in claimRewardAsMochi Function"" appears at rank 2.
   - ""Uncontrolled Slippage in Uniswap Swap and Missing Slippage Control"" appears at rank 7.

2. **Calculate the precision at each rank where a true positive appears**:
   - For rank 2: \( P@2 = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \)
   - For rank 7: \( P@7 = \frac{2}{7} \approx 0.2857 \)

3. **Average the precision values**:
   \[
   AP = \frac{0.5 + 0.2857}{2} \approx 0.39285
   \]

**Output**:

Impact

Everyone can call the function `registerAsset()` of MochiProfileV0.sol Assuming the liquidity for the asset is sufficient, `registerAsset()` will reset the _assetClass of an already registered asset to AssetClass.Sigma.
When the _assetClass is changed to AssetClass.Sigma then liquidationFactor(), riskFactor(), maxCollateralFactor(), liquidationFee() keeperFee() maxFee() will also return a different value. Then the entire vault will behave differently. The threshold for liquidation will also be different, possibly leading to a liquidation that isn't supposed to happen.

**[H-04] registerAsset() can overwrite _assetClass value**

**Report Description**:
The `registerAsset()` function in `MochiProfileV0.sol` allows any user to call it, provided the liquidity requirement is met. This function resets the `_assetClass` of an already registered asset to `AssetClass.Sigma`. Changing the `_assetClass` affects multiple critical functions such as `liquidationFactor()`, `riskFactor()`, `maxCollateralFactor()`, `liquidationFee()`, `keeperFee()`, and `maxFee()`. This can lead to unintended behavior in the vault, including incorrect liquidation thresholds, potentially causing liquidations that should not occur. The issue arises due to the lack of access control and validation to prevent overwriting an existing asset's class.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Missing Access Control for `registerAsset`""** and **""Potential Manipulation of Liquidation/Keeper/Max Collateral/Stability Fees through AssetClass""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the lack of access control in the `registerAsset` function, which is a critical part of the issue. However, it does not explicitly address the risk of overwriting the `_assetClass` value and its cascading effects on the vault's behavior. The second response partially covers the impact of changing the `AssetClass` but does not link it to the `registerAsset` function. Therefore, while the responses touch on aspects of the issue, they miss the full scope of the vulnerability.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:
- **[H-04] registerAsset() can overwrite _assetClass value**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:
- *None*

--- 

### **Detailed Analysis**

1. **Missing Access Control for `registerAsset`**:
   - This response correctly identifies the lack of access control in the `registerAsset` function, which is a key part of the issue. However, it does not address the specific risk of overwriting the `_assetClass` value or its broader implications.

2. **Potential Manipulation of Liquidation/Keeper/Max Collateral/Stability Fees through AssetClass**:
   - This response highlights the risks associated with changing the `AssetClass` but does not connect it to the `registerAsset` function. It misses the specific vulnerability of overwriting the `_assetClass` value in an uncontrolled manner.

3. **Other Responses**:
   - None of the other responses in the `response_list` address the issue of overwriting the `_assetClass` value or its impact on the vault's behavior.

### **Conclusion**
The responses partially address the issue but fail to fully capture the vulnerability and its broader implications. The lack of access control and the risk of overwriting the `_assetClass` value are critical aspects that need to be explicitly highlighted and addressed in the responses.","```

**Report Description**:  
The `veCRVlock` function in `MochiTreasury` is permissionless, allowing anyone to trigger it. This makes the treasury vulnerable to a sandwich attack, where an attacker can use a flash loan to manipulate the price of CRV during the execution of `veCRVlock`. This could result in the attacker stealing funds from the treasury. The impact is severe, as attackers could potentially drain all funds in the treasury.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential Reentrancy Vulnerability in `veCRVlock` and `veCRVInitialize` functions""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies a reentrancy vulnerability in `veCRVlock` and `veCRVInitialize`, which is related to external calls and potential manipulation of state. However, it does not explicitly address the sandwich attack vector or the use of flash loans to exploit the permissionless nature of `veCRVlock`. While the response covers some aspects of the vulnerability, it misses the critical detail of the sandwich attack, which is the core issue in this case.

### **[M-14] MochiTreasuryV0.withdrawLock() Is Callable When Locking Has Been Toggled**

**Report Description**:  
The `withdrawLock()` function in `MochiTreasuryV0` does not prevent users from calling it when locking has been toggled. This could lead to unexpected withdrawals, potentially disrupting the treasury's operations and governance. The issue is medium severity as it could allow unauthorized withdrawals of locked veCRV.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Unprotected `withdrawLock` function""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the lack of access control in the `withdrawLock` function, which allows anyone to call it. This directly aligns with the issue described in the report, where the function does not prevent withdrawals even when locking has been toggled. The response correctly highlights the risk of unauthorized withdrawals and the potential impact on the treasury's operations.

1. **Identify the ranks of true positives**:
   - The true positive is `""Unprotected withdrawLock function""`.
   - This appears at rank **5** in the ranked list of predictions.

2. **Calculate precision at rank 5**:
   - Precision at rank 5 (\( P@5 \)) is the number of true positives up to rank 5 divided by 5.
   - There is **1** true positive up to rank 5.
   - \( P@5 = \frac{1}{5} = 0.2 \).

3. **Compute the Average Precision (AP)**:
   - Since there is only **1** true positive, the AP is simply the precision at its rank.

MochiEngine allows the operator to change the NFT contract in MochiEngine.sol#L91-L93
All the vaults would point to a different NFT address. As a result, users would not be access their positions. The entire protocol would be broken.
IMHO, A function that would break the entire protocol shouldn't exist.
I consider this is a high-risk issue.

}",127.89870190620422,2963.0,26.0,"### **[H-10] Changing NFT contract in the MochiEngine would break the protocol**

**Report Description**:
The `MochiEngine` contract allows the operator to change the NFT contract address (lines 91-93 in `MochiEngine.sol`). If the NFT contract is changed, all vaults would point to a different NFT address, rendering users unable to access their positions. This would effectively break the entire protocol. The issue is considered high-risk because a function that can break the protocol should not exist.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Direct Contract Address Assignments""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the issue of directly assigning contract addresses without validation, which is relevant to the problem described in the issue report. However, the response does not specifically address the critical impact of changing the NFT contract, which would break the protocol by making user positions inaccessible. The response focuses on the general risk of incorrect interface assumptions but misses the high-risk nature of this specific vulnerability. Therefore, it is partially correct but lacks sufficient detail on the severity and impact of the issue.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:
- **[H-10] Changing NFT contract in the MochiEngine would break the protocol**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:
- *None*

---

### **Analysis**
The response list partially addresses the issue by highlighting the risks of direct contract address assignments. However, it fails to fully capture the high-risk nature of the specific vulnerability described in the issue report, which involves the potential for breaking the entire protocol by changing the NFT contract. This gap indicates a need for more detailed and specific responses to high-risk vulnerabilities in the future.","```

Impact

The VestedRewardPool.sol contract is a public facing contract aimed at vesting tokens for a minimum of 90 days before allowing the recipient to withdraw their mochi. The vest() function does not utilise safeTransferFrom() to ensure that vested tokens are correctly allocated to the recipient. As a result, it is possible to frontrun a call to vest() and effectively steal a recipient's vested tokens. The same issue applies to the lock() function.

**Report Description**:
The `VestedRewardPool.sol` contract is a public-facing contract designed to vest tokens for a minimum of 90 days before allowing recipients to withdraw their `mochi`. The `vest()` function does not use `safeTransferFrom()` to ensure that vested tokens are correctly allocated to the recipient. This oversight allows an attacker to frontrun a call to `vest()` and steal a recipient's vested tokens. The same issue applies to the `lock()` function, which also lacks proper safeguards against frontrunning.

**Match in Response List**:
No match found.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the specific issue of frontrunning vulnerabilities in the `vest()` and `lock()` functions. While the response list includes several issues related to access control, reentrancy, and integer overflow/underflow, it does not mention the lack of `safeTransferFrom()` or the potential for frontrunning attacks. This is a critical oversight, as frontrunning can lead to the theft of vested tokens, which is a high-severity vulnerability.

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:
- **[H-13] Tokens Can Be Stolen By Frontrunning VestedRewardPool.vest() and VestedRewardPool.lock()**

---

**Conclusion**:
The response list fails to address the frontrunning vulnerability in the `VestedRewardPool.sol` contract. This is a significant gap, as frontrunning attacks can lead to the theft of vested tokens, which is a high-severity issue. The response list should include a detailed analysis of the `vest()` and `lock()` functions, highlighting the need for `safeTransferFrom()` and other safeguards to prevent frontrunning attacks.","```

**[M-12] Anyone can create a vault by directly calling the factory**

**Report Description**:
The `deployVault()` function in `MochiVaultFactory.sol` lacks permission control, allowing anyone to create a vault. This could lead to unintended consequences, such as the deployment of invalid or malicious vaults. The protocol recognizes these vaults as valid because it checks the contract's address against the computed address. This issue is considered medium-risk due to the potential for abuse and the protocol's inability to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate vaults.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Lack of Access Control on `deployVault` and `getVault`""**.

**Validation**:
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the lack of access control in the `deployVault` function, which aligns with the issue described in the report. It correctly highlights the potential for unintended vault deployments and the associated risks, which are consistent with the reported vulnerability.

1. Lack of Access Control on `deployVault` and `getVault`
```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the rank of the true positive**:
   - The true positive is ""Lack of Access Control on `deployVault` and `getVault`"".
   - This issue appears at rank 8 in the ranked list of predictions.

2. **Calculate the precision at rank 8 (\( P@8 \))**:
   - Precision at rank \( k \) is the number of true positives up to rank \( k \) divided by \( k \).
   - Since there is only one true positive up to rank 8, \( P@8 = \frac{1}{8} = 0.125 \).

3. **Compute the Average Precision (AP)**:
   - Since there is only one true positive, the AP is simply the precision at the rank where the true positive appears.
   - Therefore, \( AP = 0.125 \).

**Output**:
```
0.125
