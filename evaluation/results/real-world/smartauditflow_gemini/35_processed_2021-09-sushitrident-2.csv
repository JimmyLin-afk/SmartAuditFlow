}",6722,716,"[H-01] Unsafe cast in ConcentratedLiquidityPool.burn leads to attack

Submitted by cmichel, also found by broccoli
The `ConcentratedLiquidityPool.burn` function performs an unsafe cast of a `uint128` type to a signed integer.
(uint256 amount0fees, uint256 amount1fees) = _updatePosition(msg.sender, lower, upper, -int128(amount));

Note that amount is chosen by the caller and when choosing amount = 2**128 - 1, this is interpreted as 0xFFFFFFFFF... = -1 as a signed integer. Thus -(-1)=1 adds 1 liquidity unit to the position
This allows an attacker to not only mint LP tokens for free but as this is the burn function it also redeems token0/1 amounts according to the unmodified uint128 amount which is an extremely large value.
 [H-04] Overflow in the mint function of ConcentratedLiquidityPool causes LPs' funds to be stolen

Impact

Similar to a previous finding in the IndexPool contract, the `mint` function of ConcentratedLiquidityPool allows integer overflows when checking the balance is larger or equal to the received amount of token plus the reserve. As a result, the attacker could get a large amount of liquidity but only provide a small number of tokens to the pool, effectively stealing other LPs' funds when burning his liquidity.
Notice that this bug is independent of another bug of incorrect casting uint256 type to uint128 in the _getAmountsForLiquidity function. Even if the previously mentioned bug does not exist, the attacker could still steal the funds in the pool by exploiting this bug.
 [H-05] Incorrect usage of typecasting in _getAmountsForLiquidity lets an attacker steal funds from the pool

Impact

The `_getAmountsForLiquidity` function of ConcentratedLiquidityPool explicitly converts the result of DyDxMath.getDy and DyDxMath.getDx from type uint256 to type uint128. The explicit casting without checking whether the integer exceeds the maximum number (i.e., type(uint128).max) could cause incorrect results being used. Specifically, an attacker could exploit this bug to mint a large amount of liquidity but only pay a little of token0 or token1 to the pool and effectively steal other's funds when burning his liquidity.
  [H-08] Wrong inequality when adding/removing liquidity in current price range

The `ConcentratedLiquidityPool.mint/burn` functions add/remove liquidity when (priceLower < currentPrice && currentPrice < priceUpper). Shouldn't it also be changed if priceLower == currentPrice?

[H-09] range fee growth underflow

The function RangeFeeGrowth (ConcentratedLiquidityPool.sol#L601-L633) would revert the transaction in some cases.
When a pool cross a tick, it only updates either feeGrowthOutside0 or feeGrowthOutside1. Ticks.sol#L23-L53
RangeFeeGrowth calculates the fee as follow:
    feeGrowthInside0 = _feeGrowthGlobal0 - feeGrowthBelow0 - feeGrowthAbove0;
    feeGrowthInside1 = _feeGrowthGlobal1 - feeGrowthBelow1 - feeGrowthAbove1;

feeGrowthBelow + feeGrowthAbove is not necessary smaller than _feeGrowthGlobal. Please see POC.
Users can not provide liquidity or burn liquidity. Fund will get stocked in the contract. I consider this is a high-risk issue.
 [H-10] ConcentratedLiquidityPool.burn() Wrong implementation
 The reserves should be updated once LP tokens are burned to match the actual total bento shares hold by the pool.
However, the current implementation only updated reserves with the fees subtracted.
Makes the reserve0 and reserve1 smaller than the current balance0 and balance1.
 [H-11] ConcentratedLiquidityPool: incorrect feeGrowthGlobal accounting when crossing ticks

Variable `feeGrowthGlobal` 

Swap fees are taken from the output. Hence, if swapping token0 for token1 (zeroForOne is true), then fees are taken in token1. We see this to be the case in the initialization of feeGrowthGlobal in the swap cache
feeGrowthGlobal = zeroForOne ? feeGrowthGlobal1 : feeGrowthGlobal0;
and in _updateFees().
However, looking at Ticks.cross(), the logic is the reverse, which causes wrong fee accounting.
``` if (zeroForOne) {
	...
	ticks[nextTickToCross].feeGrowthOutside0 = feeGrowthGlobal - ticks[nextTickToCross].feeGrowthOutside0;
} else {
	...
	ticks[nextTickToCross].feeGrowthOutside1 = feeGrowthGlobal - ticks[nextTickToCross].feeGrowthOutside1;
}
```  [H-12] ConcentratedLiquidityPool: secondsPerLiquidity should be modified whenever pool liquidity changes

Variable `secondsPerLiquidity`

`secondsPerLiquidity` is updated as such: `secondsPerLiquidity += uint160((diff << 128) / liquidity); where diff = timestamp - uint256(lastObservation)`. Hence, whenever liquidity changes, secondsPerLiquidity should be updated prior to the change.
In particular, this affects the mint() and burn() functions, in the case where liquidity changes when lowerTick <= currentTick < upperTick.
In fact, the latest secondsPerLiquidity value should be calculated and used in Ticks.insert(). For comparison, notice how UniswapV3 fetches the latest value by calling observations.observeSingle() in its _updatePosition() function.
 [H-13] Burning does not update reserves


The ConcentratedLiquidityPool.burn function sends out amount0/amount1 tokens but only updates the reserves by decreasing it by the fees of these amounts.
``` unchecked {
    // @audit decreases by fees only, not by amount0/amount1
    reserve0 -= uint128(amount0fees);
    reserve1 -= uint128(amount1fees);
}
```
This leads to the pool having wrong reserves after any burn action. The pool's balance will be much lower than the reserve variables.
 [H-14] ConcentratedLiquidityPool: `rangeFeeGrowth` and `secondsPerLiquidity` math needs to be unchecked


The fee growth mechanism, and by extension, secondsPerLiquidity mechanism of Uniswap V3 has the ability to underflow. It is therefore a necessity for the math to (ironically) be unsafe / unchecked.",10,,"pragma solidity >=0.8.0;

#### **[H-01] Unsafe cast in ConcentratedLiquidityPool.burn leads to attack**

**Report Description**:  
The `ConcentratedLiquidityPool.burn` function performs an unsafe cast of a `uint128` type to a signed integer. When `amount = 2**128 - 1`, it is interpreted as `-1` as a signed integer, leading to `-(-1) = 1`. This allows an attacker to mint LP tokens for free and redeem token0/1 amounts based on the unmodified `uint128` amount, which is an extremely large value.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of unsafe casting in the `burn` function. This is a critical vulnerability that allows attackers to manipulate liquidity and steal funds, but it is not covered in the response list.

---

#### **[H-04] Overflow in the mint function of ConcentratedLiquidityPool causes LPs' funds to be stolen**

**Report Description**:  
The `mint` function allows integer overflows when checking the balance against the received amount of tokens plus the reserve. This enables an attacker to provide a small number of tokens but receive a large amount of liquidity, effectively stealing other LPs' funds when burning their liquidity.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential Integer Overflow/Underflow in Arithmetic Operations""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the risk of integer overflow/underflow in arithmetic operations, which aligns with the issue described in the report. The impact of incorrect state updates and potential fund loss is also correctly highlighted.

#### **[H-05] Incorrect usage of typecasting in _getAmountsForLiquidity lets an attacker steal funds from the pool**

**Report Description**:  
The `_getAmountsForLiquidity` function explicitly converts `uint256` results to `uint128` without checking for overflow. This allows an attacker to mint a large amount of liquidity while paying very little, effectively stealing funds from the pool.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential Unsafe Type Conversions""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the risk of unsafe type conversions but does not specifically address the impact of this vulnerability in the `_getAmountsForLiquidity` function. The issue is broader than just type conversion; it involves fund theft, which is not explicitly covered.

---

#### **[H-08] Wrong inequality when adding/removing liquidity in current price range**

**Report Description**:  
The `mint` and `burn` functions add/remove liquidity only when `priceLower < currentPrice && currentPrice < priceUpper`. The logic should also account for the case where `priceLower == currentPrice`.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue, which could lead to incorrect liquidity management and potential vulnerabilities in the pool's functionality.

---

#### **[H-09] Range fee growth underflow**

**Report Description**:  
The `RangeFeeGrowth` function may revert due to underflow when calculating `feeGrowthInside0` and `feeGrowthInside1`. This prevents users from providing or burning liquidity, causing funds to be stuck in the contract.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential Integer Overflow/Underflow in Arithmetic Operations""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response correctly identifies the risk of integer underflow in arithmetic operations, which aligns with the issue described in the report. The impact of transaction reverts and fund lockup is also accurately highlighted.

---

#### **[H-10] ConcentratedLiquidityPool.burn() Wrong implementation**

**Report Description**:  
The `burn` function updates reserves only by subtracting fees, not the actual amounts of tokens burned. This leads to incorrect reserve values, as the pool's balance will be lower than the reserves.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue, which results in incorrect reserve accounting and potential vulnerabilities in the pool's state management.

---

#### **[H-11] ConcentratedLiquidityPool: incorrect feeGrowthGlobal accounting when crossing ticks**

**Report Description**:  
The `Ticks.cross` function incorrectly updates `feeGrowthOutside0` and `feeGrowthOutside1` when crossing ticks, leading to wrong fee accounting.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue, which results in incorrect fee accounting and potential vulnerabilities in the pool's fee distribution mechanism.

---

#### **[H-12] ConcentratedLiquidityPool: secondsPerLiquidity should be modified whenever pool liquidity changes**

**Report Description**:  
The `secondsPerLiquidity` variable should be updated whenever liquidity changes, particularly in the `mint` and `burn` functions. Failure to do so leads to incorrect historical tracking of time-weighted liquidity.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential Arithmetic Overflow in `secondsPerLiquidity` Calculation""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the risk of arithmetic overflow in `secondsPerLiquidity` calculations but does not address the broader issue of incorrect updates to `secondsPerLiquidity` when liquidity changes.

---

#### **[H-13] Burning does not update reserves**

**Report Description**:  
The `burn` function updates reserves only by subtracting fees, not the actual amounts of tokens burned. This leads to incorrect reserve values, as the pool's balance will be lower than the reserves.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue, which results in incorrect reserve accounting and potential vulnerabilities in the pool's state management.

---

#### **[H-14] ConcentratedLiquidityPool: rangeFeeGrowth and secondsPerLiquidity math needs to be unchecked**

**Report Description**:  
The fee growth and `secondsPerLiquidity` mechanisms are designed to allow underflow, so the math should be unchecked to avoid unnecessary reverts.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential Integer Overflow/Underflow in Arithmetic Operations""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the risk of integer underflow in arithmetic operations, which aligns with the issue described in the report. The need for unchecked math to avoid reverts is also correctly highlighted.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:
- **[H-04] Overflow in the mint function of ConcentratedLiquidityPool causes LPs' funds to be stolen**
- **[H-09] Range fee growth underflow**
- **[H-14] ConcentratedLiquidityPool: rangeFeeGrowth and secondsPerLiquidity math needs to be unchecked**

**Partially Correct Matches**:
- **[H-05] Incorrect usage of typecasting in _getAmountsForLiquidity lets an attacker steal funds from the pool**
- **[H-12] ConcentratedLiquidityPool: secondsPerLiquidity should be modified whenever pool liquidity changes**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:

- **[H-11] ConcentratedLiquidityPool: incorrect feeGrowthGlobal accounting when crossing ticks**
- **[H-13] Burning does not update reserves**

--- 

The response list covers some issues but misses critical vulnerabilities related to unsafe casting, incorrect reserve updates, and fee accounting. These gaps highlight the need for a more comprehensive review of the contract's logic and arithmetic operations.",2.0,1.0,7.0,10.0,"```
1. Potential Integer Overflow/Underflow in Arithmetic Operations 2. Potential Unsafe Type Conversions
```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the rank of the true positive**:
   - The true positive is ""Potential Integer Overflow/Underflow in Arithmetic Operations"".
   - This issue appears at rank 2 in the ranked list of predictions.

2. **Calculate the precision at rank 2 (P@2)**:
   - Precision at rank 2 is the number of true positives up to rank 2 divided by 2.
   - Since there is only one true positive up to rank 2, \( P@2 = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

3. **Compute the Average Precision (AP)**:
   - Since there is only one true positive, the AP is simply the precision at the rank where the true positive appears.
   - Therefore, \( AP = 0.5 \).

}",1294,116,"[H-02] Wrong usage of positionId in ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager

Impact

In the `subscribe` function of ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager, the incentive to subscribed is determined as follows:
Incentive memory incentive = incentives[pool][positionId];

However, positionId should be incentiveId, a counter that increases by one whenever a new incentive is added to the pool. The usage of positionId could cause the wrong incentive to be used, and in general, the incentive is not found, and the transaction reverts (the condition `block.timestamp < incentive.endTime` is not met). The getReward and claimReward functions have the bug of misusing positionId as the index of incentives.
 [H-03] ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager's incentives can be stolen

The ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager keeps all tokens for all incentives in the same contract. The `reclaimIncentive` function does not reduce the incentive.rewardsUnclaimed field and thus one can reclaim tokens several times. This allows anyone to steal all tokens from all incentives by creating an incentive themself, and once it's expired, repeatedly claim the unclaimed rewards until the token balance is empty.
 [H-16] Possible attacks on Seconds * Liquidity calculation

This is a possible line of attack on the staking contract, in particular the `claimReward()` function: ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager.sol#L90 L94
A user with some spare capital mints a liquidity position with a very tight range (1-2 ticks wide) at the current price. Because the range is so small, his position.liquidity on his NFT is large (DyDxMath.sol).
The user then sets up a bot to frontrun any price changes that someone else tries to do, burning his position after claiming rewards. He then mints a new liquidity position at the new price after the other persons trades go through.
Rinse and repeat this process. If done correctly, no funds are at risk from the bot owner, he doesn't pay any fees for burning/minting either.
So what you have left is a sequence of positions with high position.liquidity and in the correct price range all the time, without taking on any risk. Thereby stealing incentive funds.
  [M-01] Incentive should check that it hasn't started yet

The `ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager.addIncentive` function can add an incentive that already has a non-zero incentive.secondsClaimed.

[M-02] Cannot claim reward

The `ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager.claimReward` requires stake.initialized but it is never set. It also performs a strange computation as 128 - incentive.secondsClaimed which will almost always underflow and revert the transaction.
 [M-06] ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager.sol `claimReward()` and `reclaimIncentive()` will fail when incentive.token is token0 or token1

In `ConcentratedLiquidityPosition.collect()`, balances of token0 and token1 in bento will be used to pay the fees.
 In the case of someone add an incentive with `token0` or `token1`, the incentive in the balance of bento will be used to pay fees until the balance is completely consumed.
As a result, when a user calls claimReward(), the contract may not have enough balance to pay (it supposed to have it), cause the transaction to fail.",6,,"pragma solidity >=0.8.0;

#### **[H-02] Wrong usage of positionId in ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager**

**Report Description**:
The `subscribe`, `getReward`, and `claimReward` functions in `ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager` incorrectly use `positionId` instead of `incentiveId` to access the `incentives` mapping. This leads to fetching incorrect or non-existent incentive data, causing transactions to revert or users to interact with the wrong incentive.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Incentive ID Mismatch in Core Functions""**.

**Validation**:
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue of using `positionId` instead of `incentiveId` in core functions. It correctly explains the impact of this error, including malfunctioning incentive mechanisms and potential loss of rewards, which aligns with the issue report.

---

#### **[H-03] ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager's incentives can be stolen**

**Report Description**:
The `reclaimIncentive` function does not reduce the `incentive.rewardsUnclaimed` field, allowing users to repeatedly reclaim tokens until the token balance is empty. This enables theft of all tokens from all incentives.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Missed Issue**. The response list does not address the vulnerability of repeated reclaiming of incentives, which is a critical security flaw. This issue remains unaddressed.

---

#### **[H-16] Possible attacks on Seconds * Liquidity calculation**

**Report Description**:
A user can exploit the `claimReward` function by minting liquidity positions with a very tight range, frontrunning price changes, and repeatedly claiming rewards without taking on any risk. This allows the user to steal incentive funds.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Missed Issue**. The response list does not address the potential attack vector involving manipulation of liquidity positions and reward calculations. This issue remains unaddressed.

---

#### **[M-01] Incentive should check that it hasn't started yet**

**Report Description**:
The `addIncentive` function does not validate whether the incentive has already started, allowing incentives with non-zero `incentive.secondsClaimed` to be added.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Missed Issue**. The response list does not address the lack of validation for incentives that have already started. This issue remains unaddressed.

---

#### **[M-02] Cannot claim reward**

**Report Description**:
The `claimReward` function requires `stake.initialized`, but it is never set. Additionally, the calculation `128 - incentive.secondsClaimed` will almost always underflow, causing the transaction to revert.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Flawed Reward Calculation Logic and Overflows/Underflows""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the flawed reward calculation logic and potential overflows/underflows but does not explicitly mention the uninitialized `stake.initialized` field. The issue is partially addressed.

---

#### **[M-06] ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager.sol `claimReward()` and `reclaimIncentive()` will fail when incentive.token is token0 or token1**

**Report Description**:
If `incentive.token` is `token0` or `token1`, the balance in the bento contract may be used to pay fees, leaving insufficient funds for reward claims. This causes `claimReward()` and `reclaimIncentive()` to fail.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Missed Issue**. The response list does not address the issue of insufficient funds for reward claims when `incentive.token` is `token0` or `token1`. This issue remains unaddressed.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:

- **[H-02] Wrong usage of positionId in ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager**

**Partially Correct Matches**:

- **[M-02] Cannot claim reward**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:

- **[H-03] ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager's incentives can be stolen**
- **[H-16] Possible attacks on Seconds * Liquidity calculation**
- **[M-01] Incentive should check that it hasn't started yet**
- **[M-06] ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager.sol `claimReward()` and `reclaimIncentive()` will fail when incentive.token is token0 or token1**

While this prevents a revert, it might lead to a denial-of-service for users who cannot collect all their earned fees if another account has front-run them, depleting the contract\'s balance first. This is because the fees are calculated based on historical fee growth, but the actual tokens available in the contract depend on the order in which fees are collected. A malicious user can frontrun the `_transfer` by sending a small amount of either token0 or token1 to the contract, causing the `token0amount` or `token1amount` to be reduced to a very small value or zero effectively denying the position owner their rightful fees."",

}",21.4479649066925,0.0,5.0,"### **[H-06] ConcentratedLiquidityPosition.sol#collect() Users may get double the amount of yield when they call collect() before burn()**

**Report Description**:
When a user calls `ConcentratedLiquidityPosition.sol#collect()` to collect their yield, it calculates the yield based on `position.pool.rangeFeeGrowth()` and `position.feeGrowthInside0, position.feeGrowthInside1`. If there are enough tokens in `bento.balanceOf`, it will not call `position.pool.collect()` to collect fees from the pool. This allows users who call `collect()` when there is enough balance to get double yield when they call `burn()` to remove liquidity, as `burn()` will automatically collect fees on the pool contract.

**Match in Response List**:
No match found.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of double yield collection due to the interaction between `collect()` and `burn()`. The issue is specific to the logic of fee collection and the potential for users to collect fees twice, which is not covered in the response list.

---

### **[H-07] ConcentratedLiquidityPosition.sol#burn() Wrong implementation allows attackers to steal yield**

**Report Description**:
When a user calls `ConcentratedLiquidityPosition.sol#burn()` to burn their liquidity, it calls `ConcentratedLiquidityPool.sol#burn()` -> `_updatePosition()`. The `_updatePosition()` function will return `amount0fees` and `amount1fees` of the whole position with the `lower` and `upper` tick and send them to the `recipient` alongside the burned liquidity amounts. This implementation allows attackers to steal yield by manipulating the fee collection process.

**Match in Response List**:
No match found.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of yield theft due to the incorrect implementation of the `burn()` function. The issue is specific to the logic of fee distribution during the burning process, which is not covered in the response list.

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:

The response list does not adequately address the issues reported in `issue`. Both **[H-06]** and **[H-07]** are critical vulnerabilities related to fee collection and yield distribution, but they are not covered in the response list.

**[M-05] TridentNFT.permit should always check recoveredAddress != 0**

**Report Description**:
The `TridentNFT.permit` function ignores the `recoveredAddress != 0` check if `isApprovedForAll[owner][recoveredAddress]` is true. If a user accidentally sets the zero address as the operator, tokens can be stolen by anyone as a wrong signature yields `recoveredAddress == 0`. This oversight could lead to unauthorized token transfers and potential loss of assets.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the specific issue of missing the `recoveredAddress != 0` check in the `permit` function. While the response list includes issues related to `permit` and `permitAll` functions (e.g., replay attacks, front-running vulnerabilities, and domain separator inconsistencies), none of them explicitly mention the risk of ignoring the zero address check in the context of `isApprovedForAll`. This is a critical oversight, as it directly impacts the security of the `permit` function.
