 }",1101,153,"[H-01] Re-entrancy in settleAuction allow stealing all funds

Note that the `Basket` contract approved the `Auction` contract with all tokens and the `settleAuction` function allows the auction bonder to transfer all funds out of the basket to themselves. The only limiting factor is the check afterwards that needs to be abided by. It checks if enough tokens are still in the basket after settlement:
// this is the safety check if basket still has all the tokens after removing arbitrary amounts
for (uint256 i = 0; i < pendingWeights.length; i++) {
    uint256 tokensNeeded = basketAsERC20.totalSupply() * pendingWeights[i] * newRatio / BASE / BASE;
    require(IERC20(pendingTokens[i]).balanceOf(address(basket)) >= tokensNeeded);
}

The bonder can pass in any inputTokens, even malicious ones they created. This allows them to re-enter the settleAuction multiple times for the same auction.
Calling this function at the correct time (such that bondTimestamp - auctionStart makes newRatio < basket.ibRatio()), the attacker can drain more funds each time, eventually draining the entire basket.
 [M-01] Use safeTransfer instead of transfer

https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Auction.sol#L146
transfer() might return false instead of reverting, in this case, ignoring return value leads to considering it successful.
use safeTransfer() or check the return value if length of returned data is > 0.
 [M-03] onlyOwner Role Can Unintentionally Influence settleAuction()

The `onlyOwner` role is able to make changes to the protocol with an immediate affect, while other changes made in Basket.sol and Auction.sol incur a one day timelock. As a result, an onlyOwner role may unintentionally frontrun a settleAuction() transaction by making changes to auctionDecrement and auctionMultiplier, potentially causing the auction bonder to over compensate during a rebalance. Additionally, there is no way for an auction bonder to recover their tokens in the event this does happen.
 [M-07] No minimum rate in the auction may break the protocol under network failure

The aution contract decides a new `ibRatio` in the function `settleAuction`. Auction.sol#L89-L91
uint256 a = factory.auctionMultiplier() * basket.ibRatio();
uint256 b = (bondTimestamp - auctionStart) * BASE / factory.auctionDecrement();
uint256 newRatio = a - b;

There's a chance that newRatio would be really close to zero. This imposes too much risk on the protocol. The network may not really be healthy all the time. Solana and Arbitrum were down and Ethereum was suffered a forking issue recently. Also, the network may be jammed from time to time. This could cause huge damage to a protocol. Please refer to Black Thursday for makerdao 8.32 million was liquidated for 0 dai
  [M-08] settleAuction may be impossible if locked at a wrong time.

The auction contract decides a new ibRatio in the function `settleAuction`. Auction.sol#L89-L91
uint256 a = factory.auctionMultiplier() * basket.ibRatio();
uint256 b = (bondTimestamp - auctionStart) * BASE / factory.auctionDecrement();
uint256 newRatio = a - b;

In this equation, a would not always be greater than b. The  auctionBonder may lock the token in bondForRebalance() at a point that a-b would always revert.
The contract should not allow users to lock the token at the point that not gonna succeed. Given the possible (huge) loss of the user may suffer, I consider this is a medium-risk issue.",5,,"pragma solidity =0.8.7;

#### **[H-01] Re-entrancy in `settleAuction` allows stealing all funds**

**Report Description**:  
The `Basket` contract approves the `Auction` contract with all tokens, and the `settleAuction` function allows the auction bonder to transfer all funds out of the basket to themselves. The only safety check is a post-transfer validation that ensures enough tokens remain in the basket. However, the bonder can pass in malicious `inputTokens` to re-enter `settleAuction` multiple times for the same auction. By calling the function at the right time (when `newRatio < basket.ibRatio()`), the attacker can drain more funds each time, eventually draining the entire basket.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Reentrancy and Incorrect State Update in `withdrawBounty`""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies reentrancy as a vulnerability but focuses on the `withdrawBounty` function instead of `settleAuction`. While the description of reentrancy risks is accurate, it does not address the specific exploit in `settleAuction` or the role of malicious `inputTokens`. The core issue of draining funds via reentrancy in `settleAuction` is not fully covered.

---

#### **[M-01] Use `safeTransfer` instead of `transfer`**

**Report Description**:  
The `transfer` function might return `false` instead of reverting, and ignoring the return value could lead to considering the transfer successful even if it fails. The recommendation is to use `safeTransfer` or check the return value if the length of returned data is > 0.

**Match in Response List**:  
No direct match found. However, the issue is related to unchecked external calls, which is a broader category covered in the response list.

**Validation**:  
**No match found**. The response list does not explicitly address the use of `transfer` versus `safeTransfer` or the risks of ignoring return values. This issue is missed in the response list.

---

#### **[M-03] `onlyOwner` Role Can Unintentionally Influence `settleAuction()`**

**Report Description**:  
The `onlyOwner` role can make changes to the protocol with immediate effect, while other changes in `Basket.sol` and `Auction.sol` incur a one-day timelock. This allows the `onlyOwner` role to unintentionally frontrun a `settleAuction()` transaction by modifying `auctionDecrement` and `auctionMultiplier`, potentially causing the auction bonder to overcompensate during a rebalance. Additionally, there is no mechanism for the auction bonder to recover their tokens if this occurs.

**Match in Response List**:  
No direct match found.

**Validation**:  
**No match found**. The response list does not address the risks associated with the `onlyOwner` role or the potential for frontrunning `settleAuction()` transactions. This issue is missed in the response list.

---

#### **[M-07] No minimum rate in the auction may break the protocol under network failure**

**Report Description**:  
The `settleAuction` function calculates `newRatio` using the formula `a - b`, where `a = factory.auctionMultiplier() * basket.ibRatio()` and `b = (bondTimestamp - auctionStart) * BASE / factory.auctionDecrement()`. If `newRatio` becomes very close to zero, it imposes significant risk on the protocol, especially during network failures or congestion. This could lead to severe financial losses, as seen in events like Black Thursday for MakerDAO.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Incorrect Calculation and Potential Underflow/Overflow of `newRatio` in `settleAuction`""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the risks associated with the calculation of `newRatio`, including the potential for underflow and incorrect rebalancing. It also highlights the impact of network failures and the potential for significant financial loss, which aligns with the issue report.

---

#### **[M-08] `settleAuction` may be impossible if locked at a wrong time**

**Report Description**:  
The `settleAuction` function calculates `newRatio` using the formula `a - b`. If `b` becomes greater than `a`, the subtraction will underflow, causing the transaction to revert. This could happen if the auction bonder locks the token at a point where `a - b` would always revert. The contract should prevent users from locking tokens at such times to avoid potential losses.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Incorrect Calculation and Potential Underflow/Overflow of `newRatio` in `settleAuction`""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response correctly identifies the risk of underflow in the calculation of `newRatio` and the potential for the transaction to revert. It also highlights the impact on the protocol's functionality, which aligns with the issue report.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:
- **[M-07] No minimum rate in the auction may break the protocol under network failure**
- **[M-08] `settleAuction` may be impossible if locked at a wrong time**

**Partially Correct Matches**:
- **[H-01] Re-entrancy in `settleAuction` allows stealing all funds**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:
- **[M-01] Use `safeTransfer` instead of `transfer`**
- **[M-03] `onlyOwner` Role Can Unintentionally Influence `settleAuction()`**

1. Incorrect Calculation and Potential Underflow/Overflow of `newRatio` in `settleAuction`
```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the ranks of true positives in the ranked list of predictions**:
   - The true positive is: ""Incorrect Calculation and Potential Underflow/Overflow of `newRatio` in `settleAuction`"".
   - This issue appears at **rank 2** in the ranked list of predictions.

2. **Calculate the precision at the rank where the true positive appears**:
   - Precision at rank 2 (\( P@2 \)) is calculated as the number of true positives up to rank 2 divided by the rank itself.
   - Since there is only one true positive up to rank 2, \( P@2 = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

3. **Compute the Average Precision (AP)**:
   - Since there is only one true positive, the AP is simply the precision at the rank where it appears.
   - Therefore, \( AP = 0.5 \).

**Output**:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L102-L108
Given the `auctionBurn()` function will _burn() the auction bond without updating the ibRatio. Once the bond of a failed auction is burned, the proportional underlying tokens won't be able to be withdrawn, in other words, being frozen in the contract.

 [M-06] Basket becomes unusable if everybody burns their shares

Function `handleFees()`
While handling the fees, the contract calculates the new ibRatio by dividing by totalSupply. This can be 0 leading to a division by 0.
Impact

If everybody burns their shares, in the next mint, totalSupply will be 0, handleFees will revert, and so nobody will be able to use the basket anymore.
 [M-09] Fee calculation is potentially incorrect

More fees are actually charged than intended
Mitigation Steps

Basket.sol line 118
Assume that license fee is 10% i.e. 1e17 and time diff = half a year.
When you calculate feePct, you expect to get 5e16 since that's 5% and the actual amount of fee to be charged should be totalSupply * feePct (5) / BASE (100) but on line 118, we are actually dividing by BASE - feePct i.e. 95.
5 / 95 = 0.052 instead of the intended 0.05.
Solution is to replace BASE - feePct in the denominator with BASE.
  [M-10] burn and mintTo in Basket.sol vulnerable to reentrancy

The functions `mintTo` and `burn` make external calls prior to updating the state. If a basket contains an ERC777 token, attackers can mint free basket tokens.",4,,"pragma solidity =0.8.7;

#### **[H-02] Basket.sol#auctionBurn() A failed auction will freeze part of the funds**

**Report Description**:  
The `auctionBurn()` function burns the auction bond without updating the `ibRatio`. If the auction fails and the bond is burned, the proportional underlying tokens cannot be withdrawn, effectively freezing them in the contract.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of funds being frozen due to the failure to update `ibRatio` after burning the auction bond. This is a critical oversight that directly impacts the contract's functionality and user funds.

---

#### **[M-06] Basket becomes unusable if everybody burns their shares**

**Report Description**:  
The `handleFees()` function calculates the new `ibRatio` by dividing by `totalSupply`. If `totalSupply` is 0 (e.g., if all users burn their shares), the function will revert, rendering the basket unusable.

**Match in Response List**:  
**Potential Integer Overflow/Underflow in Fee Calculation** (Medium Severity).

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the risk of integer overflow/underflow in the `handleFees` function but does not explicitly address the scenario where `totalSupply` becomes 0, leading to a division by zero error. The impact of this issue is more severe than described in the response.

---

#### **[M-09] Fee calculation is potentially incorrect**

**Report Description**:  
The fee calculation in `Basket.sol` (line 118) divides by `BASE - feePct` instead of `BASE`, leading to higher fees than intended. For example, a 10% fee over half a year should result in a 5% fee, but the calculation yields ~5.2%.

**Match in Response List**:  
**Potential Integer Overflow/Underflow in Fee Calculation** (Medium Severity).

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response mentions the risk of integer overflow/underflow in fee calculations but does not address the specific issue of incorrect fee calculation due to the use of `BASE - feePct` in the denominator. This is a distinct logic error that directly impacts the fee calculation.

---

#### **[M-10] burn and mintTo in Basket.sol vulnerable to reentrancy**

**Report Description**:  
The `mintTo` and `burn` functions make external calls before updating the state. If the basket contains an ERC777 token, attackers can exploit reentrancy to mint free basket tokens.

**Match in Response List**:  
**Potential Reentrancy Vulnerability in Multiple Functions** (High Severity).

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the reentrancy risk in functions like `mint` and `burn`, which aligns with the issue described in the report. The response also correctly highlights the potential for state manipulation and theft of funds.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:

- **[M-10] burn and mintTo in Basket.sol vulnerable to reentrancy**

**Partially Correct Matches**:

- **[M-06] Basket becomes unusable if everybody burns their shares**
- **[M-09] Fee calculation is potentially incorrect**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:

- **[H-02] Basket.sol#auctionBurn() A failed auction will freeze part of the funds**

---

### **Conclusion**

The response list covers some issues but misses critical vulnerabilities like the freezing of funds in `auctionBurn()`. Additionally, while some issues are partially addressed, the responses often lack specificity or fail to fully capture the severity and impact of the reported vulnerabilities. Improvements are needed to ensure comprehensive coverage of all identified risks.",0.0,0.0,,,"```

Fee on transfer tokens can lead to incorrect approval

The createBasket function does not account for tokens with fee on transfer.

The function safeTransferFrom may not transfer exactly bProposal.weights[i] amount of tokens, for tokens with a fee on transfer. This means that the safeApprove call in the next line would be approving more tokens than what was received, leading to accounting issues.

[M-12] Factory.sol - lack of checks in setAuctionDecrement will cause reverts in Auction::settleAuction()

Submitted by Alex the Entreprenerd, also found by goatbug
Impact

setAuctionDecrement doesn't check for a min nor a max amount This means we can change auctionDecrement which would allow owner to set auctionDecrement to 0
This will cause the function settleAuction in Auction.sol to revert
This allows the owner to block auctions from being settled",2,,"pragma solidity =0.8.7;

}",23.0810868740082,0.0,5.0,"### **[M-02] Fee on transfer tokens can lead to incorrect approval**

**Report Description**:
The `createBasket` function does not account for tokens with a fee on transfer. The function uses `safeTransferFrom` to transfer tokens from the user to the contract and then uses `safeApprove` to approve the basket contract to spend those tokens. However, for tokens with a fee on transfer, the actual amount transferred may be less than the specified `bProposal.weights[i]`. This discrepancy can lead to incorrect approvals, where the basket contract is approved to spend more tokens than were actually transferred, potentially causing accounting issues.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Unchecked TransferFrom and Approve in `createBasket` Function""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the issue with `safeTransferFrom` and `safeApprove` in the `createBasket` function, but it does not specifically address the problem of fee-on-transfer tokens. The response focuses on the general risks of unchecked `safeTransferFrom` and `safeApprove` calls, such as potential loss of funds and unexpected approvals, but it misses the critical detail that fee-on-transfer tokens can lead to incorrect approvals due to the discrepancy between the transferred and approved amounts. This oversight means the response does not fully cover the issue described in the report.

### **[M-12] Factory.sol - lack of checks in `setAuctionDecrement` will cause reverts in Auction::settleAuction()**

**Report Description**:
The `setAuctionDecrement` function in `Factory.sol` does not include checks for minimum or maximum values. This allows the owner to set `auctionDecrement` to 0, which will cause the `settleAuction` function in `Auction.sol` to revert. This effectively blocks auctions from being settled, potentially leading to a denial of service.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Centralized Control Over Key Parameters""**.

**Validation**:
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue of centralized control over key parameters, including `auctionDecrement`. It correctly explains the risks associated with the owner being able to set extreme values for these parameters, which aligns with the issue described in the report. The response also mentions the potential for denial of service, which is directly related to the impact of setting `auctionDecrement` to 0. Therefore, the response fully covers the issue.
