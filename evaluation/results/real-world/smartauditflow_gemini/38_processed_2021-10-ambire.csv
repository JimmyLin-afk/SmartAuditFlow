Impact

Suppose one of the supplied addrs\[i] to the constructor of Identity.sol happens to be 0 ( by accident).
In that case: privileges\[0] = 1
Now suppose you call execute() with an invalid signature, then recoverAddrImpl will return a value of 0 and thus signer=0. If you then check ""privileges\[signer] !=0"" this will be true and anyone can perform any transaction.
This is clearly an unwanted situation.
Proof of Concept

Identity.sol#L23 L30
Identity.sol#L97 L98
 [H-04] QuickAccManager Smart Contract signature verification can be exploited

Several different signature modes can be used and Identity.execute forwards the signature parameter to the SignatureValidator library. The returned signer is then used for the privileges check:
address signer = SignatureValidator.recoverAddrImpl(hash, signature, true);
// signer will be QuickAccountContract
require(privileges[signer] != bytes32(0), 'INSUFFICIENT_PRIVILEGE');

It's possible to create a smart contract mode signature (SignatureMode.SmartWallet) for arbitrary transactions as the QuickAccManager.isValidSignature uses an attacker-controlled id identity contract for the privileges check. An attacker can just create an attacker contract returning the desired values and the smart-wallet signature appears to be valid:
// @audit id is attacker-controlled
(address payable id, uint timelock, bytes memory sig1, bytes memory sig2) = abi.decode(signature, (address, uint, bytes, bytes));
// @audit this may not be used for authorization, attacker can return desired value
if (Identity(id).privileges(address(this)) == accHash) {
  // bytes4(keccak256(""isValidSignature(bytes32,bytes)"")

**Report Description**:
The issue describes a vulnerability in the `Identity.sol` contract where an invalid signature can lead to unauthorized execution. Specifically, if one of the `addrs[i]` in the constructor is accidentally set to `0`, the `privileges[0]` is set to `1`. When `execute()` is called with an invalid signature, `recoverAddrImpl` returns `0`, and the check `privileges[signer] != 0` evaluates to `true`, allowing anyone to perform any transaction. Additionally, the `QuickAccManager` smart contract's signature verification can be exploited by creating a smart contract mode signature for arbitrary transactions, as the `isValidSignature` function uses an attacker-controlled `id` identity contract for the privileges check.

**Match in Response List**:
No direct match found. The response list does not explicitly address the issue of invalid signatures leading to unauthorized execution or the exploitation of `QuickAccManager`'s signature verification.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not cover the specific vulnerabilities described in the issue. While it discusses signature validation dependencies and potential weaknesses, it does not address the core issue of invalid signatures allowing unauthorized execution or the exploitation of `QuickAccManager`'s signature verification. Therefore, the response is incorrect in addressing this specific issue.

### **[H-04] QuickAccManager Smart Contract signature verification can be exploited**

**Report Description**:
The issue highlights a vulnerability in the `QuickAccManager` smart contract where the signature verification can be exploited. An attacker can create a smart contract mode signature for arbitrary transactions by controlling the `id` identity contract used in the `isValidSignature` function. The attacker can return the desired values, making the smart-wallet signature appear valid, thus bypassing the intended security checks.

No direct match found. The response list does not explicitly address the exploitation of `QuickAccManager`'s signature verification.

 [H-03] Signature replay attacks for different identities (nonce on wrong party)

Submitted by cmichel, also found by WatchPug
A single QuickAccount can serve as the ""privilege"" for multiple identities, see the comment in QuickAccManager.sol:
NOTE: a single accHash can control multiple identities, as long as those identities set it's hash in privileges[address(this)]. this is by design
If there exist two different identities that both share the same QuickAccount (identity1.privileges(address(this)) == identity2.privileges(address(this)) == accHash) the following attack is possible in QuickAccManager.send:
Upon observing a valid send on the first identity, the same transactions can be replayed on the second identity by an attacker calling send with the same arguments and just changing the identity to the second identity.
This is because the identity is not part of the hash. Including the nonce of the identity in the hash is not enough.
Two fresh identities will both take on nonces on zero and lead to the same hash.",2,,"pragma solidity ^0.8.7;

}",239.261636018753,3767.0,35.0,"### **[H-02] QuickAccManager.sol#cancel() Wrong hashTx makes it impossible to cancel a scheduled transaction**

**Report Description**:
In `QuickAccManager.sol#cancel()`, the `hashTx` used to identify the transaction to be canceled is incorrect. The last parameter (`false`) is missing in the `keccak256` hash calculation. As a result, users will be unable to cancel a scheduled transaction because the `hashTx` generated in `cancel()` does not match the one stored during the scheduling process. This renders the cancellation functionality non-functional.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Critical Hashing Mismatches Preventing `cancel` and `execScheduled` Functionality""**.

**Validation**:
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue with the hash calculation in the `cancel` function. It explains the inconsistency in the hash parameters across `send`, `cancel`, and `execScheduled`, which directly aligns with the reported issue. The response correctly highlights the impact of this mismatch, which is the inability to cancel scheduled transactions.

### **[H-03] Signature replay attacks for different identities (nonce on wrong party)**

**Report Description**:
A single `QuickAccount` can serve as the ""privilege"" for multiple identities. If two different identities share the same `QuickAccount`, an attacker can replay a valid `send` transaction from one identity to another. This is because the `identity` parameter is not included in the hash calculation, and the nonce is tied to the `QuickAccount` rather than the identity. As a result, the same transaction can be replayed across identities, leading to unauthorized executions.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this specific issue. While some responses discuss nonce handling and replay vulnerabilities, none explicitly cover the scenario where the `identity` parameter is excluded from the hash calculation, allowing replay attacks across identities sharing the same `QuickAccount`.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:

- **[H-02] QuickAccManager.sol#cancel() Wrong hashTx makes it impossible to cancel a scheduled transaction**

**Partially Correct Matches**:

- *None*

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:

- **[H-03] Signature replay attacks for different identities (nonce on wrong party)**

---

### **Conclusion**
The response list effectively addresses the issue with the `hashTx` calculation in the `cancel` function but misses the critical vulnerability related to signature replay attacks across identities sharing the same `QuickAccount`. This gap highlights the need for a more comprehensive review of identity-specific security concerns in the contract.","```
