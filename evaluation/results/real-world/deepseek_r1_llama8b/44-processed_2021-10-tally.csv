}",2733,263,"[H-01] Arbitrary contract call allows attackers to steal ERC20 from users' wallets
A call to an arbitrary contract with custom calldata is made in `fillZrxQuote()`, which means the contract can be an ERC20 token, and the calldata can be `transferFrom` a previously approved user.
  [H-02] Wrong calculation of erc20Delta and ethDelta
“function fillZrxQuote()”
When a user tries to swap unwrapped ETH to ERC20, even if there is a certain amount of ETH refunded, at L215, `ethDelta` will always be 0.
That's because `originalETHBalance` already includes the `msg.value` sent by the caller.
Let's say the ETH balance of the contract is 1 ETH before the swap.
- A user swaps 10 ETH to USDC;
- `originalETHBalance` will be 11 ETH;
- If there is 1 ETH of refund;
- `ethDelta` will be 0 as the new balance is 2 ETH and `subOrZero(2, 11)` is 0.
Similarly, erc20Delta is also computed wrong.
Consider a special case of a user trying to arbitrage from WBTC to WBTC, the `originalERC20Balance` already includes the input amount, erc20Delta will always be much lower than the actual delta amount.
For example, for an arb swap from 1 WBTC to 1.1 WBTC, the ethDelta will be 0.1 WBTC while it should be 1.1 WBTC.
  [M-01] Swap.sol implements potentially dangerous transfer
The use of `transfer()` in  Swap.sol may have unintended outcomes on the eth being sent to the receiver. Eth may be irretrievable or undelivered if the msg.sender or feeRecipient is a smart contract. Funds can potentially be lost if;
The smart contract fails to implement the payable fallback function
The fallback function uses more than 2300 gas units
The latter situation may occur in the instance of gas cost changes. The impact would mean that any contracts receiving funds would potentially be unable to retrieve funds from the swap.   [M-02] Unused ERC20 tokens are not refunded
Based on the context and comments in the code, we assume that it's possible that there will be some leftover sell tokens, not only when users are selling unwrapped ETH but also for ERC20 tokens.
However, in the current implementation, only refunded ETH is returned (L158).
Because of this, the leftover tkoens may be left in the contract unintentionally.
 
[M-03] Users can avoid paying fees for ETH swaps
Users can call `Swap.swapByQuote()` to execute an ETH swap (where they receive ETH) without paying swap fee for the gained ETH. They can trick the system by setting `zrxBuyTokenAddress` to an address of a malicious contract and making it think they have executed an ERC20 swap when they have actually executed an ETH swap. In this case, the system will give them the ETH they got from the swap (`boughtETHAmount`) without charging any swap fees for it, because the systems consideres this ETH as ""refunded ETH"" that wasn't part of the ""ERC20"" swap.",5,"pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

}",1505,2,3,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out the vulnerabilities in this smart contract. Let's start by reading through the code and understanding what it does.

The contract is called Swap and is using emergency pausability, reentrancy guard, and some OpenZeppelin libraries. It has a feeRecipient and a swap fee. The swap fee is set in the constructor and can be updated later by only timelock, which means only the timelock multisig can change it.

Looking at the swapByQuote function, which seems to handle token swaps. It takes parameters like the address of the token to sell, the amount to sell, the token to buy, minimum amount received, the allowance target, the recipient, some data, and a deadline. The function also takes a payable msg.value, which makes it a token bridge or something.

First, I notice that the function uses internal functions like fillZrxQuote. The fillZrxQuote function is called with msg.value and some data. It calls zrxTo.call with ethAmount. If zrxTo is an external contract, this might be a way to trigger reentrancy or exploit if it's not properly guarded.

The function is marked as payable, so any ETH transferred to it could potentially be mishandled. Also, the use of external payable functions often is a risk because they can be called without checking the caller's origin, which can lead to reentrancy attacks.

The swapByQuote function does have a nonReentrant guard, which is good, but let me check if all possible entry points are covered. The fallback and receive functions are payable, which is a classic spot for reentrancy. But since the function has nonReentrant, maybe that's covered.

Another point is the use of the suggestETHOrZero function. It checks if a token is ETH or zero, which is a common gotcha. Using ETH directly could bypass certain checks, but in this case, it's properly handled in the swap function.

The constructor initializes the fee recipient and swap fee. The setSwapFee and setFeeRecipient functions are only accessible by the timelock, which is a good security practice. However, I should check if these functions are timelocked correctly and if there are any vulnerabilities in how they are called.

The sweepFees function seems to transfer accumulated fees to the fee recipient. However, if the tokens array is manipulated, or if the fee recipient isn't properly checked, this could be a point of leakage or theft. Also, since it's nonReentrant, but perhaps it's not the only check.

Potential issues I'm seeing:

1. The use of external payable functions like swapByQuote can be targeted without reentrancy unless properly secured.
2. The fillZrxQuote function calls an external contract, zrxTo.call, which could lead to reentrancy if that contract's functions don't properly check calls.
3. The SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR is a fixed value, but if the swap fee is altered, it could leave a percentage vulnerable. However, the setSwapFee function does check that it's under 100%, so that's covered.

Thinking about variable names, I see some tokens being checked with signifiesETHOrZero. If someone uses an ERC20 token that's not properly checked, but in this code, it seems okay.

Another thing: in the swapByQuote function, when handling the bought tokens, they check if boughtERC20Amount is greater than zero and proceed accordingly. But what if there's an issue with the calculation of toTransfer? For example, if SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR is 100000, and swapFee is, say, 50000, then the fee is 50%? Not sure if that's intended, but if so, maybe the math is correct.

Wait, looking at toTransfer calculation: toTransfer = SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR - swapFee. Then multiplied by the amount, divided by the SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR. That seems to take a percentage. For example, if SWAP_FEE is 5 (in 100000 units), the fee is 5/(100000) = 0.05% or 5 basis points, but if SWAP_FEE is 50000, that's 50% fee, but setSwapFee ensures it's under 100%, so 50000 is allowed but that's 50%.

Wait, no, if SWAP_FEE is 50000, then SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR - swapFee is 50000, so toTransfer becomes 50000 * amount / 100000, which is 50000 / 100000 = 0.5, so 0.5% fee. Oh, I see, the SWAP_FEE is in basis points of the divisor. So the fee rate is (SWAP_FEE / SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR) * 100. So if swapFee is 10000, fee is 10%, but the setSwapFee function allows up to 100000, but in that case, the fee would be 100%.

Wait, the code shows that the fee is subtracted or calculated as toTransfer. So 1% is 1000, so 1000 is 1 basis point. So the function is correct.

But maybe the fee calculation is not handled correctly if the token is for example, bought as ETH. Let's see: if boughtETHAmount is the amount received, then toTransfer is (100000 - swapFee) * boughtETHAmount / 100000. That is the same as (100000 / 100000 = 1) * boughtETHAmount - (swapFee / 100000) * boughtETHAmount. So the fee is swapFee / 100000 * boughtETHAmount.

But when swapFee is 100000, that would mean 100000 / 100000 = 1, so the entire boughtETHAmount is taken as fee and nothing is transferred. Which would mean that the swap fee for ETH is 100%, which is reasonable.

Hmm, seems okay.

Now, looking for reentrancy risks:

- The fallback and receive are external payable functions. When someone sends ETH to the contract, they can call receive, which is payable. But in the code, the function is not marked as notReentrant, so that can be a problem. But wait, in the code, the receive and fallback are both payable, but no nonReentrant or whenNotPaused. So if the contract is not paused, and has no reentrancy guard on these functions, an attacker could use a reentrancy attack by calling receive or fallback recursively.

The swapByQuote function is marked with whenNotPaused and nonReentrant, which is good. But the other functions, like setSwapFee and setFeeRecipient, are marked with onlyTimelock. Is the function in the timelock also notReentrant? I don't see that, but the timelock itself might have security.

But the main issue is that receive and fallback are payable without reentrancy guard, so those can be entry points for reentrancy attacks.

So that's one vulnerability: no reentrancy guard on receive or fallback.

Another possible issue is that the emergencyPausable allows the contract to be paused, but what if an attacker can trigger the emergency pause without proper authorization?

Wait, no, the emergencyPausable is initialized with a certain value, and by default, it's not paused. Only the timelock can pause or unpause, so that's a safe use.

Another possible issue is in the fillZrxQuote function. It calls zrxTo.call with ethAmount and data. If zrxTo is a malicious contract, this can lead to reentrancy if not handled properly. For example, if the called function doesn't check the caller's balance or origin, it could cause the contract to keep receiving ETH, leading to a stuck state or draining the balance.

Wait, looking at fillZrxQuote:

zrxTo is supposed to be a relayer, I think. It calls zrxTo with ethAmount. If zrxTo is a smart contract that doesn't handle reentrancy, an attacker can call this function, and when it calls back, it would trigger the swapByQuote function again, leading to a loop.

So if the fillZrxQuote calls an external contract without ensuring that it can handle reentrancy, this could be a vulnerability.

But how is fillZrxQuote called? It's internal, so only called from within the contract. So the function inside the contract is calling the external zrxTo. So if the zrxTo is a Governance or something that allows writing to the contract, this could cause issues. But if it's properly implemented, it's okay.

Another point is that the function fills the quote, and then in swapByQuote, it's processed. But the problem is that fillZrxQuote may not check if zrxTo is a safe contract.

Wait, in OpenZeppelin, they have a relayer contract which is trusted, but if a attacker provides a malicious address, this can cause issues. So the contract is assuming that the zrxTo is a trusted third party. If that's not the case, then the fillZrxQuote could lead to loss of funds. But that's more of a business risk, not a smart contract vulnerability in the code itself.

Another thing is that the fee recipient can be changed, but there's no check whether the new fee recipient is a trusted address. But since the setFeeRecipient function is protected by onlyTimelock, which is a multisig, it's secure.

Now, looking for other issues.

In the swapByQuote function, after calculating boughtERC20 and boughtETH, it then proceeds. If the zrxAllowanceTarget isn't zero, it does some approve and transfer. But I don't see any checks on the amounts. It just transfers from msg.sender to address(this), and then increases the allowance. Then in the buy function, it fills the quote and gets the tokens.

But what if the zrxAllowanceTarget's balance isn't handled properly? Or if the allowance isn't sufficient. But in the code, it's increased by the amountToSell, so if the target allows enough, it's okay.

Another thing is that if the tokens[] array in sweepFees is empty, but the feeRecipient is supposed to receive the address's balance. But in the code, it correctly loops and checks if balance > 0. So that's okay.

Potential issues in the code:

1. receive and fallback are payable without reentrancy guard. This is a critical vulnerability because they can be called by attackers to initiate reentrancy attacks. Since they are both payable, any recursive calls could exploit the balance.

2. Using internal functions to call external contracts (like zrxTo.call) without proper reentrancy protection on zrxTo. But this is more of a reliance on external contracts being secure, which may or may not be within the contract's control.

3. The SWAP_FEE is calculated as a fixed divisor, but it's scaled correctly, so that shouldn't be a problem. However, if it were a variable fee, it could cause issues, but here it's a fixed percentage.

4. The way the fee is calculated (divisor - swapFee) * amount. Wait, that's incorrect. Wait, toTransfer is (SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR - swapFee).mul(amount).div(SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR). So for example, if swapFee is 100000 (max allowed), then SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR - swapFee is zero, so the fee is zero.

But the way it's written: if you have swapFee as X, then (divisor - X) is the numerator, multiplied by the amount, then divided by the divisor.

Which is equivalent to (amount * (divisor - X)) / divisor = amount * (divisor/(divisor) - X/(divisor)) = amount * (1 - X/100000) ?

No, actually, it's (divisor - X) * amount * (1/ divisor). Because (divisor - X) / divisor is (1 - X / divisor).

Yes, it's 1 - (X / divisor). So it's 1 - 0.001% per unit? No, wait, if X is in the same units as the divisor.

Wait, if swapFee is in the same units as divisor. For example, if divisor is 100,000, swapFee is 50,000, then the fee is (100,000 - 50,000)/100,000 * amount = (50,000)/100,000 = 0.5. So 0.5 * amount is the fee, 0.5% rate.

Wait, no, wait: toTransfer = (SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR - swapFee).mul(amount).div(SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR). That's equivalent to (SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR - swapFee)/SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR * amount. So (SWAP_FEE / SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR) * amount which is (X / 100000) * amount.

So for swapFee = 10000, the fee rate is 10%. So that's correct.

Wait, no, if swapFee is 10,000, then toTransfer is (100,000 - 10,000) * amount / 100,000 = 90,000 * amount / 100,000 = 0.9 amount. Then amount received is (0.9 amount). So the fee is 10,000.

Wait, that makes no sense. Because the fee is per transaction, not per amount.

I think I'm confused. Let me make a concrete example.

Suppose SWAP_FEE is 10,000 and amount is 100,000.

toTransfer = (100000 - 10000) * 100000 / 100000 = (90000)*100000/100000 = 90000.

Wait, that's not correct because if the amount is 100,000 and the fee is 10%, then the received amount should be 90,000, and the fee is 10,000. So the calculation above actually gives toTransfer as 90,000, which is the correct received amount. Then the fee is 10,000, but how is the fee extracted? Because the function then transfers boughtERC20 or boughtETH.

Wait, in the code, it's the amount sent to the user, and the fee is taken from the amount. So if boughtERC20 is 100,000, and the fee is 10%, then toTransfer is 90,000 sent to the user, and the fee (10,000) is kept.

But in the code, the SweptFees function is for fees that have been collected. The main fee is the swapFee, collected when each swap occurs. So the way the code is written seems correct.

Wait, but in the function swapByQuote, if the amount is 100,000 in ETH, and the fee is 10%, then the user gets 90,000 and the contract gets 10,000. But how is that 10,000 tracked? Because it's not explicitly stored unless the contract has some balance tracking.

But if the tokens are ERC20, then the fee is taken from the tokens. But if it's ETH, the fee is taken from the msg.value.

Wait, looking at the code: in the case where boughtERC20 is greater than zero, the fee is taken as a portion. But how is that i'mputed correctly.

Wait, another issue is that when the function is handling the fee, it's not storing that fee or tracking it. So the funds are taken on the spot without proof that the fee was collected. That could be a problem if the user disputes the fee.

But from a security standpoint, the code in swapByQuote correctly calculates the fee and transfers the net amount to the user.

I think I'm getting into too much detail on the fee calculation. Let me focus on the vulnerabilities.

2 main vulnerabilities I can see:

- receive and fallback are payable without reentrancy guard.
- The external call to zrxTo in fillZrxQuote without a reentrancy guard.

But in the contract, the swapByQuote function is guarded by nonReentrant, which is good. However, the receive and fallback functions do not have this, making them prone to reentrancy attacks.

So I'd say those are the primary vulnerabilities. Also, if any of the other functions do not properly check for reentrancy, they could be entry points. But in this case, the main issue is those two functions.

Wait, looking again:

The swapByQuote function is external and is marked with whenNotPaused and nonReentrant. So it's safe from reentrancy. The fillZrxQuote is internal, so it's less likely to be attacked directly. The issue is more in the receive and fallback, which are possibly not guarded.

Additionally, if any of the external functions that are not timelocked can be called without proper permissions, that could be a problem, but that's more about the contract's design.

Another thing to check: the emergencyPausable is initialized with a specific value, but is it possible that the pauser can be an attacker? Probably not, since the timelock locks changes, which are secure.

Putting it all together, the critical vulnerabilities are:

1. The fallback and receive functions are payable without reentrancy protection, allowing potential reentrancy attacks.
2. The use of external calls in fillZrxQuote to zrxTo without ensuring that zrxTo is protected against reentrancy, though this is less direct because zrxTo is an external contract.

So I'd list these as vulnerabilities in the contract.","The vulnerabilities identified in the `Swap` smart contract are as follows:

1. **Reentrancy Risk in `receive` and `fallback` Functions:**
   - **Explanation:** The `receive` and `fallback` functions are payable and lack reentrancy guards (`nonReentrant`), making them susceptible to reentrancy attacks. Attackers can send ETH to these functions, potentially exploiting the contract by causing recursive calls to other functions, leading to loss of funds or contract halting.
   - **Mitigation:** Implement `nonReentrant` guard on both `receive` and `fallback` functions to prevent reentrancy attacks.

2. **Potential External Call Vulnerability in `fillZrxQuote` Function:**
   - **Explanation:** The function calls `zrxTo.call` with `ethAmount`, assuming that the external contract is secure. If `zrxTo` is a malicious contract, it could lead to reentrancy by not properly checking the caller's origin or balance, causing the `Swap` contract to drain funds.
   - **Mitigation:** Ensure that `zrxTo` is a trusted, verified contract and that it properly handles reentrancy. If possible, enforce reentrancy guards within the `zrxTo` contract.

These vulnerabilities pose significant risks to the security and functionality of the smart contract, particularly in scenarios where attackers may exploit the lack of proper reentrancy protection.","### Analysis of Alignment Between `issue` and `response_list`

---

#### **[H-01] Arbitrary contract call allows attackers to steal ERC20 from users' wallets**

**Report Description**:  
The `fillZrxQuote()` function makes an arbitrary contract call with custom calldata, which could be exploited to call `transferFrom` on a previously approved ERC20 token, allowing attackers to steal tokens from users' wallets.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential External Call Vulnerability in `fillZrxQuote` Function""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the risk of external calls in `fillZrxQuote` but focuses on reentrancy rather than the specific issue of arbitrary `transferFrom` calls. It does not address the core problem of allowing arbitrary contract calls with custom calldata, which is the root cause of the vulnerability.

**Suggestions**:  
The response should explicitly mention the risk of arbitrary contract calls and recommend restricting the calldata or ensuring that only trusted contracts are called. Additionally, it should suggest validating the target contract and calldata to prevent malicious `transferFrom` calls.

---

#### **[H-02] Wrong calculation of `erc20Delta` and `ethDelta`**

**Report Description**:  
The `fillZrxQuote()` function incorrectly calculates `erc20Delta` and `ethDelta` due to the inclusion of `msg.value` in `originalETHBalance` and the input amount in `originalERC20Balance`. This leads to incorrect refund amounts and potential loss of funds.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
This issue is entirely unaddressed in the `response_list`. The incorrect calculations pose a significant risk to the contract's functionality and user funds.

**Suggestions**:  
The response should address this issue by recommending a review of the calculation logic for `erc20Delta` and `ethDelta`. Specifically, it should suggest excluding `msg.value` from `originalETHBalance` and the input amount from `originalERC20Balance` to ensure accurate refund calculations.

---

#### **[M-01] Swap.sol implements potentially dangerous transfer**

**Report Description**:  
The use of `transfer()` in `Swap.sol` may lead to unintended outcomes, such as funds being irretrievable or undelivered if the recipient is a smart contract with a fallback function that consumes more than 2300 gas or lacks a payable fallback function.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
This issue is entirely unaddressed in the `response_list`. The use of `transfer()` is a known anti-pattern in Solidity due to its fixed gas stipend, which can cause issues with certain smart contracts.

**Suggestions**:  
The response should recommend replacing `transfer()` with `call()` to provide a higher gas stipend and ensure compatibility with all recipient contracts. Additionally, it should suggest validating the success of the transfer to handle potential failures.

---

#### **[M-02] Unused ERC20 tokens are not refunded**

**Report Description**:  
The current implementation only refunds leftover ETH, leaving unused ERC20 tokens in the contract unintentionally. This could lead to a loss of user funds.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
This issue is entirely unaddressed in the `response_list`. The failure to refund unused ERC20 tokens is a significant oversight that could result in financial losses for users.

**Suggestions**:  
The response should recommend implementing a mechanism to refund unused ERC20 tokens to users. This could involve tracking the leftover tokens and transferring them back to the user at the end of the transaction.

---

#### **[M-03] Users can avoid paying fees for ETH swaps**

**Report Description**:  
Users can exploit the system by setting `zrxBuyTokenAddress` to a malicious contract, tricking the system into treating an ETH swap as an ERC20 swap and avoiding swap fees for the gained ETH.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
This issue is entirely unaddressed in the `response_list`. The ability to bypass swap fees is a significant vulnerability that could lead to financial losses for the contract owner.

**Suggestions**:  
The response should recommend validating the `zrxBuyTokenAddress` to ensure it is a legitimate ERC20 token address. Additionally, it should suggest implementing a mechanism to detect and prevent fee evasion in ETH swaps.
