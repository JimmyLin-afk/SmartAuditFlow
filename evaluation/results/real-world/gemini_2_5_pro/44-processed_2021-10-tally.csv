}",2733,263,"[H-01] Arbitrary contract call allows attackers to steal ERC20 from users' wallets
A call to an arbitrary contract with custom calldata is made in `fillZrxQuote()`, which means the contract can be an ERC20 token, and the calldata can be `transferFrom` a previously approved user.
  [H-02] Wrong calculation of erc20Delta and ethDelta
“function fillZrxQuote()”
When a user tries to swap unwrapped ETH to ERC20, even if there is a certain amount of ETH refunded, at L215, `ethDelta` will always be 0.
That's because `originalETHBalance` already includes the `msg.value` sent by the caller.
Let's say the ETH balance of the contract is 1 ETH before the swap.
- A user swaps 10 ETH to USDC;
- `originalETHBalance` will be 11 ETH;
- If there is 1 ETH of refund;
- `ethDelta` will be 0 as the new balance is 2 ETH and `subOrZero(2, 11)` is 0.
Similarly, erc20Delta is also computed wrong.
Consider a special case of a user trying to arbitrage from WBTC to WBTC, the `originalERC20Balance` already includes the input amount, erc20Delta will always be much lower than the actual delta amount.
For example, for an arb swap from 1 WBTC to 1.1 WBTC, the ethDelta will be 0.1 WBTC while it should be 1.1 WBTC.
  [M-01] Swap.sol implements potentially dangerous transfer
The use of `transfer()` in  Swap.sol may have unintended outcomes on the eth being sent to the receiver. Eth may be irretrievable or undelivered if the msg.sender or feeRecipient is a smart contract. Funds can potentially be lost if;
The smart contract fails to implement the payable fallback function
The fallback function uses more than 2300 gas units
The latter situation may occur in the instance of gas cost changes. The impact would mean that any contracts receiving funds would potentially be unable to retrieve funds from the swap.   [M-02] Unused ERC20 tokens are not refunded
Based on the context and comments in the code, we assume that it's possible that there will be some leftover sell tokens, not only when users are selling unwrapped ETH but also for ERC20 tokens.
However, in the current implementation, only refunded ETH is returned (L158).
Because of this, the leftover tkoens may be left in the contract unintentionally.
 
[M-03] Users can avoid paying fees for ETH swaps
Users can call `Swap.swapByQuote()` to execute an ETH swap (where they receive ETH) without paying swap fee for the gained ETH. They can trick the system by setting `zrxBuyTokenAddress` to an address of a malicious contract and making it think they have executed an ERC20 swap when they have actually executed an ETH swap. In this case, the system will give them the ETH they got from the swap (`boughtETHAmount`) without charging any swap fees for it, because the systems consideres this ETH as ""refunded ETH"" that wasn't part of the ""ERC20"" swap.",5,"pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

}",1505,2,3,"Okay, let's analyze the provided Solidity smart contract for potential vulnerabilities. Here's a breakdown:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Lack of Input Validation on `swapByQuote`:**
    *   **Issue:** The `swapByQuote` function takes several critical parameters from the user, including token addresses (`zrxSellTokenAddress`, `zrxBuyTokenAddress`), amounts (`amountToSell`, `minimumAmountReceived`), and a deadline. While there's a check for the deadline, there's *no* explicit validation to ensure that the token addresses are valid ERC20 contract addresses or that the amounts are reasonable.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Incorrect Token Handling:**  If `zrxSellTokenAddress` isn't a valid ERC20 contract, the `safeTransferFrom` call will revert, but only after the user may have already transferred ETH (if `msg.value` is used).
        *   **Front-Running:** A malicious actor could monitor the transaction and, if they observe a large `amountToSell`, attempt to front-run the transaction by manipulating the price of the tokens, causing the swap to fail the `minimumAmountReceived` check.  The user could lose gas without a successful swap.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Add checks using `try/catch` blocks when interacting with the token contracts to verify they are valid ERC20 contracts. Consider using an interface check (e.g., attempt a `name()` or `symbol()` call) within the `try` block to confirm the contract's type.
        *   Implement slippage tolerance within the `minimumAmountReceived` calculation to allow for small price fluctuations.
        *   Consider adding a maximum amount check to prevent users from accidentally swapping extremely large amounts.

2.  **Potential Reentrancy in `sweepFees`:**
    *   **Issue:** While the `sweepFees` function has the `nonReentrant` modifier, the `feeRecipient.transfer(address(this).balance)` call *could* be vulnerable to reentrancy if the `feeRecipient` is a contract that has a payable fallback/receive function that consumes a lot of gas.
    *   **Impact:** A malicious `feeRecipient` could potentially re-enter the `sweepFees` function during the ETH transfer, possibly draining more ETH than intended if the `balance` changes during the execution.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Use a ""pull"" pattern instead of a ""push"" pattern. Instead of directly sending the ETH to the `feeRecipient`, update the contract's state to record the amount of ETH owed to the `feeRecipient`. Then, have the `feeRecipient` call a separate `withdrawFees` function to claim their ETH.
        *   ReentrancyGuard only protects against reentrancy within the contract itself.  It doesn't protect against reentrancy through external calls to contracts like `feeRecipient`.

3.  **Possible Denial of Service in `sweepFees`:**
    *   **Issue:** The `sweepFees` function iterates through an array of tokens provided by the user. If a user provides a very large array, the gas cost of the transaction could exceed the block gas limit, causing the transaction to fail and preventing legitimate users from sweeping fees.
    *   **Impact:** The `sweepFees` function could become unusable, preventing the contract owner from withdrawing accrued fees.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Limit the maximum number of tokens that can be swept in a single transaction.
        *   Implement a pagination mechanism, allowing the fees to be swept in smaller batches over multiple transactions.

4.  **Missing Zero-Address Check on `tokens` array in `sweepFees`:**
    *   **Issue:** The `sweepFees` function iterates through the `tokens` array without checking if any of the addresses are the zero address (`address(0)`).
    *   **Impact:** If a zero address is passed in the `tokens` array, the `IERC20(tokens[i])` call will try to create an IERC20 interface from the zero address, which could lead to unexpected behavior. The likely result is the `balanceOf` call on the zero address will return 0, and the function will continue without issue. However, it's best to handle this gracefully.
    *   **Mitigation:** Add a check within the loop to ensure that `tokens[i]` is not the zero address.

5.  **Approve to Zero Before TransferFrom:**
    *   **Issue:** In `swapByQuote`, tokens are transferred from the user to the contract with `IERC20(zrxSellTokenAddress).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountToSell);`. Then, the contract approves the `zrxAllowanceTarget` with `IERC20(zrxSellTokenAddress).safeIncreaseAllowance(zrxAllowanceTarget, amountToSell);`. After the zrx interaction, the contract attempts to set the allowance to zero with `IERC20(zrxSellTokenAddress).safeApprove(zrxAllowanceTarget, 0);`. If the `zrxAllowanceTarget` is malicious, they can potentially frontrun the `safeApprove(zrxAllowanceTarget, 0)` transaction and steal the tokens.
    *   **Impact:** A malicious `zrxAllowanceTarget` can potentially steal the tokens.
    *   **Mitigation:** Call `safeApprove(zrxAllowanceTarget, 0)` before the `safeIncreaseAllowance` call. This removes the potential for the malicious target to frontrun the approval.

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Centralization of Ownership:** The contract relies on an owner/timelock mechanism through the `EmergencyPausable` contract. It's important to carefully consider the implications of this centralized control, as the owner can pause the contract or change critical parameters like the swap fee.
*   **Gas Optimization:** The code could potentially be optimized for gas efficiency. For example, caching the length of the `tokens` array in `sweepFees` could save gas on each iteration.

By addressing these vulnerabilities and carefully considering the overall design, you can significantly improve the security and reliability of the smart contract. Remember to conduct thorough testing and auditing before deploying any smart contract to a production environment.","### **[H-01] Arbitrary contract call allows attackers to steal ERC20 from users' wallets**

**Report Description**:
The `fillZrxQuote()` function makes a call to an arbitrary contract with custom calldata, which could be an ERC20 token. The calldata can include a `transferFrom` call targeting a previously approved user, allowing attackers to steal ERC20 tokens from users' wallets.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of arbitrary contract calls or the potential for ERC20 token theft. This is a critical vulnerability that is entirely missed in the response list.

---

### **[H-02] Wrong calculation of `erc20Delta` and `ethDelta`**

**Report Description**:
The `fillZrxQuote()` function incorrectly calculates `erc20Delta` and `ethDelta`. For ETH swaps, `ethDelta` is always `0` because `originalETHBalance` already includes the `msg.value`. Similarly, `erc20Delta` is miscalculated when swapping the same token (e.g., WBTC to WBTC), leading to incorrect delta values.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of incorrect delta calculations in `fillZrxQuote()`. This is a significant oversight, as it could lead to incorrect token accounting and potential financial losses.

---

### **[M-01] Swap.sol implements potentially dangerous transfer**

**Report Description**:
The `transfer()` function in `Swap.sol` may lead to unintended outcomes when sending ETH to smart contracts. If the recipient is a contract that does not implement a payable fallback function or uses more than 2300 gas units, funds may be irretrievable or undelivered.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of using `transfer()` for ETH transfers, which is a known vulnerability in Solidity. This oversight could lead to lost funds.

---

### **[M-02] Unused ERC20 tokens are not refunded**

**Report Description**:
The current implementation of `fillZrxQuote()` only refunds ETH, leaving unused ERC20 tokens in the contract. This could result in unintended token accumulation, especially when users sell ERC20 tokens.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of unused ERC20 tokens not being refunded. This is a missed opportunity to improve the contract's functionality and user experience.

---

### **[M-03] Users can avoid paying fees for ETH swaps**

**Report Description**:
Users can bypass swap fees for ETH swaps by setting `zrxBuyTokenAddress` to a malicious contract. This tricks the system into treating the ETH swap as an ERC20 swap, allowing users to receive ETH without paying fees.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of fee avoidance in ETH swaps. This is a significant vulnerability that could lead to revenue loss for the contract owner.
