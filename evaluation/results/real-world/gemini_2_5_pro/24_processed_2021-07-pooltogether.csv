}",3524,331,"[H-01] `onlyOwnerOrAssetManager` can swap Yield Source in SwappableYieldSource at any time, immediately rugging all funds from old yield source
The function `swapYieldSource` SwappableYieldSource.sol` L307
Can be called by the owner (deployer / initializer) or Asset Manager. The function will take all funds from the old Yield Source, and transfer them to the new Yield source. Any contract that implement the function function depositToken() external returns (address) will pass the check
However, if either the owner or the `assetManager` have malicious intent, this function allows them to instantly rug all funds

 [H-02] redeemToken can fail for certain tokens
The `SwappableYieldSource.redeemToken` function transfers tokens from the contract back to the sender, however, it uses the `ERC20.transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, redeemableBalance)` function for this. Some deposit token implementations might fail as transferFrom checks if the contract approved itself for the redeemableBalance instead of skipping the allowance check in case the sender is the from address.   [H-03] setYieldSource leads to temporary wrong results
The use of `setYieldSource` leaves the contract in a temporary inconsistent state because it changes the underlying yield source, but doesn't (yet) transfer the underlying balances, while the shares stay the same.
The function `balanceOfToken` will show the wrong results, because it is based on `_sharesToToken`, which uses yieldSource.balanceOfToken(address(this)), that isn't updated yet.
More importantly supplyTokenTo will give the wrong amount of shares back: First it supplies tokens to the yieldsource. Then is calls `_mintShares`, which calls `_tokenToShares`, which calculates the shares, using yieldSource.balanceOfToken(address(this)) This yieldSource.balanceOfToken(address(this)) only contains the just supplied tokens, but doesn't include the tokens from the previous YieldSource. So the wrong amount of shares is given back to the user; they will be given more shares than appropriate which means they can drain funds later on (once transferFunds has been done).
  [H-04] SwappableYieldSource: Missing same deposit token check in transferFunds() `transferFunds()` will transfer funds from a specified yield source _yieldSource to the current yield source set in the contract _currentYieldSource. However, it fails to check that the deposit tokens are the same. If the specified yield source's assets are of a higher valuation, then a malicious owner or asset manager will be able to exploit and pocket the difference.
  [M-01] Single-step process for critical ownership transfer/renounce is risky The `SwappableYieldSource` allows owners and asset managers to set/swap/transfer yield sources/funds. As such, the contract ownership plays a critical role in the protocol.
Given that `AssetManager` is derived from `Ownable`, the ownership management of this contract defaults to `Ownable`’s `transferOwnership()` and `renounceOwnership()` methods which are not overridden here. Such critical address transfer/renouncing in one-step is very risky because it is irrecoverable from any mistakes.   [M-02] Use of `safeApprove` will always cause `approveMax` to revert
Unlike SwappableYieldSource which uses safeIncreaseAllowance to increase the allowance to uint256.max, mStableYieldSource uses OpenZeppelin’s safeApprove() which has been documented as (1) Deprecated because of approve-like race condition and (2) To be used only for initial setting of allowance (current allowance == 0) or resetting to 0 because it reverts otherwise.
The usage here is intended to allow increase of allowance when it falls low similar to the documented usage in SwappableYieldSource. Using it for that scenario will not work as expected because it will always revert if current allowance is != 0. The initial allowance is already set as uint256.max in constructor. And once it gets reduced, it can never be increased using this function unless it is invoked when allowance is reduced completely to 0. See issue page for referenced code.
 
[M-03] Inconsistent balance when supplying transfer-on-fee or deflationary tokens
The `supplyTokenTo` function of SwappableYieldSource assumes that amount of _depositToken is transferred to itself after calling the safeTransferFrom function (and thus it supplies amount of token to the yield source). However, this may not be true if the _depositToken is a transfer-on-fee token or a deflationary/rebasing token, causing the received amount to be less than the accounted amount. SwappableYieldSource.sol L211-L212   [M-04] Old yield source still has infinite approval After swapping a yield source, the old yield source still has infinite approval. Infinite approval has been used in large attacks if the yield source isn't perfectly safe (see furucombo).",8,"pragma solidity 0.7.6;

}",1938,4,4,"Based on the provided code, here's a breakdown of potential vulnerabilities and areas of concern:

**High Risk**

*   **Incorrect `_requireYieldSource` check:** The check within `_requireYieldSource` appears to be flawed. It attempts to validate the `yieldSource` by checking if `depositTokenAddress != address(0)`, which means the function requires an *invalid* yield source. The logic should be reversed to ensure `isInvalidYieldSource` is `true` when `depositTokenAddress != address(0)`. This could allow initialization with an address that isn't a valid yield source, leading to unpredictable behavior and potential loss of funds.
*   **Approval to `yieldSource`:** In the `initialize` function, the code calls `IERC20Upgradeable(_yieldSource.depositToken()).safeApprove(address(_yieldSource), type(uint256).max);`. It approves the `yieldSource` contract with `type(uint256).max`, which is dangerous as it gives unlimited approval to the `yieldSource`. This could be exploited if the `yieldSource` is malicious or compromised.

**Medium Risk**

*   **Rounding Errors in Shares Calculation:** The contract uses a fixed-point library for calculating shares. While fixed-point math helps prevent overflow, rounding errors can occur, especially with large numbers or small decimal differences. Over time, these small errors can accumulate, potentially leading to discrepancies between token and share balances. This could unfairly disadvantage users during minting or burning.
*   **Reentrancy Risk in `transferFunds`:** While the contract uses `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable`, the `transferFunds` function calls `_yieldSource.redeemToken(_amount)` and `_currentYieldSource.supplyTokenTo(currentBalance, address(this));`. If either of these functions in the external `yieldSource` contracts have reentrancy vulnerabilities, it can potentially lead to unexpected behavior or loss of funds.

**Low Risk / Considerations**

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `transferERC20` function checks if the token being transferred is not the `yieldSource`, but doesn't validate the recipient address (`to`). Transferring to the zero address would result in a loss of funds.
*   **Potential Denial of Service (DoS):** While not a direct vulnerability, if the external `yieldSource` contract becomes unresponsive or experiences issues, the `SwappableYieldSource` contract may become unusable, leading to a denial of service for users.
*   **Governance Risk:** The contract relies heavily on the correct implementation and security of the external `IYieldSource` interface. If a malicious or faulty `IYieldSource` is set by the owner, it can have a detrimental impact on the `SwappableYieldSource` and its users.

**Recommendations**

1.  **Fix `_requireYieldSource` Check:**  Reverse the logic in the `_requireYieldSource` function to properly validate the yield source address.
2.  **Limit Approval Amounts:** Instead of `approveMaxAmount()`, calculate the required approval amount dynamically. This significantly reduces the risk associated with unlimited approvals.
3.  **Implement Safeguards for Rounding Errors:** Consider adding safeguards to minimize the impact of rounding errors in the share calculation functions (`_tokenToShares` and `_sharesToToken`). This could involve setting a small tolerance or implementing a mechanism to redistribute small differences.
4.  **Review External Contract Security:** Thoroughly review the security of the external `IYieldSource` contracts that this contract interacts with. Audit the potential for reentrancy vulnerabilities and ensure that the external contracts are well-tested and maintained.
5.  **Validate Recipient Address:** In the `transferERC20` function, add a check to ensure that the `to` address is not the zero address.
6.  **Consider Circuit Breaker:** Implement a circuit breaker mechanism that allows the owner to temporarily pause critical functions in case of an emergency or vulnerability discovery in the underlying `yieldSource`.
7.  **Increase Test Coverage:** Write comprehensive unit and integration tests to cover all possible scenarios, including edge cases, error conditions, and interactions with different `yieldSource` implementations.

By addressing these vulnerabilities and implementing the recommendations, the security and reliability of the `SwappableYieldSource` contract can be significantly improved. It's crucial to conduct a thorough security audit before deploying the contract to a production environment.","### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

---

#### **[H-01] `onlyOwnerOrAssetManager` can swap Yield Source in `SwappableYieldSource` at any time, immediately rugging all funds from old yield source**

**Report Description**:  
The `swapYieldSource` function in `SwappableYieldSource.sol` allows the owner or asset manager to transfer all funds from the old yield source to a new one. If either the owner or asset manager has malicious intent, they can instantly rug all funds, leading to a significant loss of user funds.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.  

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of malicious actors rugging funds through the `swapYieldSource` function. This is a critical oversight, as the issue highlights a severe trust assumption and potential for abuse.

---

#### **[H-02] `redeemToken` can fail for certain tokens**

**Report Description**:  
The `redeemToken` function in `SwappableYieldSource.sol` uses `ERC20.transferFrom` to transfer tokens back to the sender. However, some tokens may fail if the contract has not approved itself for the `redeemableBalance`. This could lead to failed transactions and user frustration.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.  

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of `transferFrom` failing for certain tokens due to allowance checks. This is a significant oversight, as it impacts the contract's compatibility with a wide range of ERC20 tokens.

---

#### **[H-03] `setYieldSource` leads to temporary wrong results**

**Report Description**:  
The `setYieldSource` function changes the underlying yield source but does not immediately transfer the underlying balances. This leaves the contract in an inconsistent state, causing `balanceOfToken` and `supplyTokenTo` to return incorrect results. Users may receive more shares than appropriate, leading to potential fund draining.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.  

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of temporary inconsistencies caused by `setYieldSource`. This is a critical oversight, as it directly impacts the contract's accounting and user trust.

---

#### **[H-04] `SwappableYieldSource`: Missing same deposit token check in `transferFunds()`**

**Report Description**:  
The `transferFunds` function fails to check if the deposit tokens of the old and new yield sources are the same. If the old yield source's assets are of higher valuation, a malicious owner or asset manager could exploit this to pocket the difference.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.  

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of missing deposit token checks in `transferFunds`. This is a significant oversight, as it opens the door to financial exploitation.

---

#### **[M-01] Single-step process for critical ownership transfer/renounce is risky**

**Report Description**:  
The `SwappableYieldSource` contract uses `Ownable`'s `transferOwnership` and `renounceOwnership` methods, which are single-step and irrecoverable. This is risky, as mistakes in ownership transfer or renouncement could lead to permanent loss of control over the contract.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.  

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of single-step ownership transfer/renouncement. This is a significant oversight, as it impacts the contract's governance and security.

---

#### **[M-02] Use of `safeApprove` will always cause `approveMax` to revert**

**Report Description**:  
The `mStableYieldSource` contract uses OpenZeppelin’s `safeApprove`, which is deprecated and will revert if the current allowance is not zero. This prevents the function from increasing the allowance, rendering it ineffective.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.  

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of `safeApprove` reverting due to non-zero allowances. This is a significant oversight, as it impacts the contract's functionality.

---

#### **[M-03] Inconsistent balance when supplying transfer-on-fee or deflationary tokens**

**Report Description**:  
The `supplyTokenTo` function assumes that the full `amount` of `_depositToken` is transferred to the contract. However, transfer-on-fee or deflationary tokens may result in a lower received amount, leading to inconsistencies in the contract's accounting.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.  

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of inconsistent balances caused by transfer-on-fee or deflationary tokens. This is a significant oversight, as it impacts the contract's accounting and user trust.

---

#### **[M-04] Old yield source still has infinite approval**

**Report Description**:  
After swapping a yield source, the old yield source retains infinite approval. This could be exploited if the old yield source is compromised, leading to potential loss of funds.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.  

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of infinite approval for old yield sources. This is a significant oversight, as it poses a security risk.
