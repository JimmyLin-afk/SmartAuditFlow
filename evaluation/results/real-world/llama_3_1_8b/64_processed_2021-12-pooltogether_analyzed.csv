}",3228,378,"[H-01] `createPromotion()` Lack of input validation for `_epochDuration` can potentially freeze promotion creator's funds
In the current implementation of `createPromotion()`, `_epochDuration` is allowed to be `0`.
However, when `_epochDuration = 0`, it will be impossible for users to claim the rewards, and the promotion creator won't be able to cancel it.

[H-02] Backdated `_startTimestamp` can lead to loss of funds
Function `createPromotion()`
This can lead to loss of funds as there is no recovery function of funds stuck like this

[H-03] Continue claiming reqrds after numberOfEpochs are over
When claiming rewards via `claimRewards()`, the function `_calculateRewardAmount()` is called. The function `_calculateRewardAmount()` has a check to make sure the epoch is over
  “require(block.timestamp > _epochEndTimestamp, “TwabRewards/epoch-not-over"");"" 
However neither functions check if the `_epochId` is within the range of the reward epochs. Ergo it is possible to continue claiming rewards after the reward period is over. This only works as long as there are enough tokens in the contract. But this is the case when not everyone has claimed, or other rewards use the same token.

[H-04] cancelPromotion is too rigorous
When you cancel a promotion with `cancelPromotion()` then the promotion is complete deleted. This means no-one can claim any rewards anymore, because `_promotions[_promotionId]` no longer exists.
It also means all the unclaimed tokens (of the previous epochs) will stay locked in the contract.

[H-05] Malicious tickets can lead to the loss of all tokensIt allows an attacker to retrieve all the tokens of each promotions.
Anyone can create a new promotion using `createPromotion()`. An attacker can create a new malicious promotion with the following parameters:
- the address of a malicious ticket smart contract
- the token address from the targeted promotion(s)
- optionally, `_numberOfEpochs` equal to 0 to create this promotion for free
The only verification made on the ticket address given by `_requireTicket()` is that the smart contract must implement the `ITicket` interface.

[H-06] Rewards can be claimed multiple times
An attacker can claim its reward 256 * `epochDuration` seconds after the timestamp at which the promotion started. The vulnerability allows him to claim a reward several times to retrieve all the tokens associated to the promotion.
The function `claimRewards()` claim rewards for a given promotion and epoch. In order to prevent a user from claiming a reward multiple times, the mapping _claimedEpochs keeps track of claimed rewards per user:

[H-07] Contract does not work with fee-on transfer tokens
Function `_calculateRewardAmount()`
There exist ERC20 tokens that charge a fee for every transfer.
This kind of token does not work correctly with the `TwabRewards` contract as the rewards calculation for an user is based on `promotion.tokensPerEpoch`.
However, the actual amount of tokens the contract holds could be less than `promotion.tokensPerEpoch * promotion.numberOfEpochs` leading to not claimable rewards for users claiming later than others.

[M-01] `cancelPromotion()` Unable to cancel unstarted promotions
For unstarted promotions, `cancelPromotion()` will revert at `block.timestamp - _promotion.startTimestamp` in `_getCurrentEpochId()`.
Call stack: `cancelPromotion()` -> `_getRemainingRewards()` -> `_getCurrentEpochId()`.

[M-02] `getRewardsAmount` doesn't check epochs haven't been claimed
In ITwabRewards.sol, it is claimed that `getRewardsAmount` should account for epochs that have already been claimed, and not include these epochs in the total amount (indeed, there is a line that says @dev Will be 0 if user has already claimed rewards for the epoch.)
However, no such check is done in the implementation of getRewardsAmount. This means that users will be shown rewardAmounts that are higher than they should be, and users will be confused when they are transferred fewer tokens than they are told they will. This would cause confusion, and people may begin to mistrust the contract since they think they are being transferred fewer tokens than they are owed.

[M-03] Dust Token Balances Cannot Be Claimed By An `admin` Account
Users who have a small claim on rewards for various promotions, may not feasibly be able to claim these rewards as gas costs could outweigh the sum they receive in return. Hence, it is likely that a dust balance accrues overtime for tokens allocated for various promotions. Additionally, the `_calculateRewardAmount` calculation may result in truncated results, leading to further accrual of a dust balance. Therefore, it is useful that these funds do not go to waste

[M-04] Unsafe uint64 casting may overflow
The `_calculateRewardAmount` function casts epoch timestamps from uint256 to uint64 and these may overflow. The epochStartTimestamp value is a function of the user-supplied `_epochId` value, which could be extremely large (up to 2**255 – 1). While Solidity 0.8.x checks for overflows on arithmetic operations, it does not do so for casting – the OpenZeppelin SafeCast library offers this. The overflow condition could cause `_epochStartTimestamp` > `_epochEndTimestamp`, which the Ticket.sol getAverageBalanceBetween may not be expected to handle. The `_epochStartTimestamp` could overflow to have a value before the actual start of the promotion, also impacting the rewards calculation.

[M-05] Missing Check When Transferring Tokens Out For A Given Promotion
The claimRewards function is called upon by ticket holders who parse a set of `_epochIds` they wish to claim rewards on. An internal call is made to _calculateRewardAmount to calculate the correct reward amount owed to the user. Subsequently, the _updateClaimedEpoch function will set the epoch bit of the tracked _claimedEpochs mapping, ensuring an epochId cannot be claimed twice for a given promotion.
However, there may be inaccuracies in the `_calculateRewardAmount` function, which results in more tokens being sent out than allocated by a promotion creator. This severely impacts the ability for users to claim their owed tokens on other promotions.",12,"pragma solidity 0.8.6;

}",1979,7,5,"Spotting vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts requires a detailed, step-by-step approach. операций.
Breaking down promotion features
The contract manages promotions with details like the creator, ticket, token, tokensPerEpoch, startTimestamp, epochDuration, numberOfEpochs, and mappings for claimant data.
Spotting vulnerabilities
I’m piecing together potential issues like reentrancy in claimRewards. SafeERC20 is used, but it’s worth considering ReentrancyGuard for extra security, even though no critical reentrancy seems apparent.
Evaluating risks
I'm thinking through overflow/underflow, access control, and potential denial of service in claimRewards with large epochIds. Also, considering the risks of using a bitmask for claimed epochs.
Analyzing timestamp manipulation
I'm examining how block.timestamp variations can affect epoch calculations. Using SafeERC20 and valid ticket checks ensures trustworthy rewards, even if epochId handling requires attention.
Revisiting safety measures
Malicious ticket contracts might introduce risks like reentrancy. Ensuring promotions exist before claiming and preventing crypto underflow with Solidity 0.8+ make for more robust security.
Ensuring token transfers
I'm piecing together the safety of token transfers in createPromotion and extendPromotion, guarded by SafeERC20. Also, double-checking epoch handling to avoid shifts modulo 256.
Ensuring epoch compliance
I’m checking that epochId is within the correct range and that epochs are finished to prevent incorrect reward claims. Also, confirming precision in _calculateRewardAmount calculations.
Ensuring promotion integrity
I’m piecing together the need to confirm startTimestamp is not in the future to avoid claimReward failures due to uninitiated epochs. Also, checking that createPromotion parameters are valid.
Ensuring valid inputs
I'm working through the need to validate parameters like epochDuration and numberOfEpochs in createPromotion and extendPromotion to avoid issues like division by zero or untimed promotions.
Assessing risks
I’m noting the potential for front-running attacks with extendPromotion, the lack of a reentrancy guard as best practice, and the ability for users to create promotions without trust.","The following vulnerabilities have been identified in the given solidity code:

1.  **Reentrancy Vulnerability**: The contract has a reentrancy vulnerability due to the lack of proper reentrancy protection. Specifically, the `claimRewards` function transfers tokens to the user after claiming rewards, but before updating the claimed epochs. This allows an attacker to re-enter the function multiple times, causing the contract to transfer tokens multiple times.

2.  **Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerability**: The contract has a DoS vulnerability due to the lack of proper input validation. Specifically, the `createPromotion` function allows an attacker to create a promotion with a very large number of epochs, causing the contract to run out of gas.

3.  **Integer Overflow Vulnerability**: The contract has an integer overflow vulnerability due to the use of `uint256` variables. Specifically, the `calculateRewardAmount` function calculates the reward amount by multiplying the average balance by the tokens per epoch, but if the result overflows the `uint256` limit, it will wrap around and cause incorrect results.

4.  **Front-Running Vulnerability**: The contract has a front-running vulnerability due to the lack of proper gas optimization. Specifically, the `claimRewards` function updates the claimed epochs after transferring tokens to the user, but before updating the claimed epochs. This allows an attacker to front-run the transaction and claim rewards multiple times.

5.  **Gas Limit Exceeded Vulnerability**: The contract has a gas limit exceeded vulnerability due to the lack of proper gas optimization. Specifically, the `createPromotion` function creates a promotion with a very large number of epochs, causing the contract to exceed the gas limit.

6.  **Unprotected External Call Vulnerability**: The contract has an unprotected external call vulnerability due to the lack of proper input validation. Specifically, the `requireTicket` function calls the `controller` function of the ticket contract without validating the input, allowing an attacker to call the `controller` function with malicious input.

7.  **Unprotected Internal Call Vulnerability**: The contract has an unprotected internal call vulnerability due to the lack of proper input validation. Specifically, the `requirePromotionActive` function calls the `startTimestamp` and `epochDuration` functions of the promotion without validating the input, allowing an attacker to call the `startTimestamp` and `epochDuration` functions with malicious input.

8.  **Unprotected External Library Call Vulnerability**: The contract has an unprotected external library call vulnerability due to the lack of proper input validation. Specifically, the `getAverageBalanceBetween` and `getAverageTotalSuppliesBetween` functions of the ticket contract are called without validating the input, allowing an attacker to call the functions with malicious input.

To fix these vulnerabilities, the following changes should be made:

*   Add reentrancy protection to the `claimRewards` function.
*   Add input validation to the `createPromotion` function to prevent large numbers of epochs.
*   Use `uint128` variables to prevent integer overflows in the `calculateRewardAmount` function.
*   Update the claimed epochs before transferring tokens to the user in the `claimRewards` function.
*   Optimize the gas usage of the `createPromotion` function to prevent gas limit exceeded errors.
*   Validate the input of the `requireTicket` function to prevent malicious calls to the `controller` function.
*   Validate the input of the `requirePromotionActive` function to prevent malicious calls to the `startTimestamp` and `epochDuration` functions.
*   Validate the input of the `getAverageBalanceBetween` and `getAverageTotalSuppliesBetween` functions to prevent malicious calls.````

**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of fee-on-transfer tokens or the resulting reward discrepancies.

---

### **[M-01] `cancelPromotion()` Unable to cancel unstarted promotions**

**Report Description**:  
The `cancelPromotion()` function reverts for unstarted promotions due to a timestamp check in `_getCurrentEpochId()`, preventing cancellation.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of unstarted promotions or the inability to cancel them.

---

### **[M-02] `getRewardsAmount` doesn't check epochs haven't been claimed**

**Report Description**:  
The `getRewardsAmount` function does not account for already claimed epochs, leading to incorrect reward amounts and user confusion.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of claimed epochs or incorrect reward calculations.

---

### **[M-03] Dust Token Balances Cannot Be Claimed By An `admin` Account**

**Report Description**:  
Dust token balances accrue over time due to gas costs and truncated calculations, but there is no mechanism for an admin to claim these balances.
