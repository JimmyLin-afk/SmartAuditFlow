}",2733,263,"[H-01] Arbitrary contract call allows attackers to steal ERC20 from users' wallets
A call to an arbitrary contract with custom calldata is made in `fillZrxQuote()`, which means the contract can be an ERC20 token, and the calldata can be `transferFrom` a previously approved user.
  [H-02] Wrong calculation of erc20Delta and ethDelta
“function fillZrxQuote()”
When a user tries to swap unwrapped ETH to ERC20, even if there is a certain amount of ETH refunded, at L215, `ethDelta` will always be 0.
That's because `originalETHBalance` already includes the `msg.value` sent by the caller.
Let's say the ETH balance of the contract is 1 ETH before the swap.
- A user swaps 10 ETH to USDC;
- `originalETHBalance` will be 11 ETH;
- If there is 1 ETH of refund;
- `ethDelta` will be 0 as the new balance is 2 ETH and `subOrZero(2, 11)` is 0.
Similarly, erc20Delta is also computed wrong.
Consider a special case of a user trying to arbitrage from WBTC to WBTC, the `originalERC20Balance` already includes the input amount, erc20Delta will always be much lower than the actual delta amount.
For example, for an arb swap from 1 WBTC to 1.1 WBTC, the ethDelta will be 0.1 WBTC while it should be 1.1 WBTC.
  [M-01] Swap.sol implements potentially dangerous transfer
The use of `transfer()` in  Swap.sol may have unintended outcomes on the eth being sent to the receiver. Eth may be irretrievable or undelivered if the msg.sender or feeRecipient is a smart contract. Funds can potentially be lost if;
The smart contract fails to implement the payable fallback function
The fallback function uses more than 2300 gas units
The latter situation may occur in the instance of gas cost changes. The impact would mean that any contracts receiving funds would potentially be unable to retrieve funds from the swap.   [M-02] Unused ERC20 tokens are not refunded
Based on the context and comments in the code, we assume that it's possible that there will be some leftover sell tokens, not only when users are selling unwrapped ETH but also for ERC20 tokens.
However, in the current implementation, only refunded ETH is returned (L158).
Because of this, the leftover tkoens may be left in the contract unintentionally.
 
[M-03] Users can avoid paying fees for ETH swaps
Users can call `Swap.swapByQuote()` to execute an ETH swap (where they receive ETH) without paying swap fee for the gained ETH. They can trick the system by setting `zrxBuyTokenAddress` to an address of a malicious contract and making it think they have executed an ERC20 swap when they have actually executed an ETH swap. In this case, the system will give them the ETH they got from the swap (`boughtETHAmount`) without charging any swap fees for it, because the systems consideres this ETH as ""refunded ETH"" that wasn't part of the ""ERC20"" swap.",5,"pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

}",1505,2,3,"The following are the vulnerabilities identified in the given solidity code:

1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**: The `swapByQuote` function does not properly handle reentrancy attacks. It is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks because it uses the `safeTransfer` function, which does not check if the transfer is being executed in the middle of another transfer.

2. **Front Running Vulnerability**: The `swapByQuote` function is vulnerable to front running attacks because it does not properly handle the deadline. If a user submits a transaction to swap tokens and the deadline is reached before the transaction is mined, the user can submit another transaction to swap the tokens, which can lead to a front running attack.

3. **Unprotected Function Calls**: The `fillZrxQuote` function is called from the `swapByQuote` function without proper checks. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the `fillZrxQuote` function is modified or if it has unintended side effects.

4. **Insufficient Error Handling**: The `fillZrxQuote` function does not properly handle errors. If the `fillZrxQuote` function fails to fill the quote, it will revert the transaction without providing any information about the error.

5. **Missing Input Validation**: The `swapByQuote` function does not properly validate the input. It does not check if the `zrxSellTokenAddress` and `zrxBuyTokenAddress` are valid addresses, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the addresses are invalid.

6. **Missing Output Validation**: The `fillZrxQuote` function does not properly validate the output. It does not check if the `erc20Delta` and `ethDelta` are valid values, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the values are invalid.

7. **Missing Permission Checks**: The `swapByQuote` function does not properly check the permissions of the user. It does not check if the user has the necessary permissions to swap tokens, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the user does not have the necessary permissions.

8. **Missing Contract State Validation**: The `swapByQuote` function does not properly validate the contract state. It does not check if the contract is in a valid state before swapping tokens, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the contract is not in a valid state.

9. **Missing Event Emission**: The `swapByQuote` function does not properly emit events. It does not emit events when the swap is successful or when the swap fails, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the events are not emitted.

10. **Missing Fee Calculation**: The `swapByQuote` function does not properly calculate the fees. It does not calculate the fees correctly, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the fees are not calculated correctly.

11. **Missing Token Validation**: The `swapByQuote` function does not properly validate the tokens. It does not check if the tokens are valid before swapping them, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the tokens are invalid.

12. **Missing Contract Upgrade**: The `swapByQuote` function does not properly handle contract upgrades. It does not check if the contract is being upgraded before swapping tokens, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the contract is being upgraded.

13. **Missing Reentrancy Guard**: The `swapByQuote` function does not properly use the reentrancy guard. It does not use the reentrancy guard to prevent reentrancy attacks, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the reentrancy guard is not used.

14. **Missing Contract Pause**: The `swapByQuote` function does not properly handle contract pauses. It does not check if the contract is paused before swapping tokens, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the contract is paused.

15. **Missing Event Handling**: The `swapByQuote` function does not properly handle events. It does not handle events correctly, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the events are not handled correctly.

16. **Missing Fee Transfer**: The `swapByQuote` function does not properly transfer fees. It does not transfer fees correctly, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the fees are not transferred correctly.

17. **Missing Contract State Update**: The `swapByQuote` function does not properly update the contract state. It does not update the contract state correctly, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the contract state is not updated correctly.

18. **Missing Event Emission**: The `swapByQuote` function does not properly emit events. It does not emit events correctly, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the events are not emitted correctly.

19. **Missing Fee Calculation**: The `swapByQuote` function does not properly calculate fees. It does not calculate fees correctly, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the fees are not calculated correctly.

20. **Missing Token Validation**: The `swapByQuote` function does not properly validate tokens. It does not validate tokens correctly, which","### **Output**

**[H-01] Arbitrary contract call allows attackers to steal ERC20 from users' wallets**

**Report Description**:
The `fillZrxQuote()` function makes a call to an arbitrary contract with custom calldata, which can be an ERC20 token and the calldata can be `transferFrom` a previously approved user. This allows attackers to steal ERC20 tokens from users' wallets by exploiting the arbitrary contract call.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of arbitrary contract calls or the potential for ERC20 token theft. This is a critical vulnerability that is entirely missed in the response list.

---

**[H-02] Wrong calculation of erc20Delta and ethDelta**

**Report Description**:
The `fillZrxQuote()` function incorrectly calculates `erc20Delta` and `ethDelta`. For example, when swapping unwrapped ETH to ERC20, `ethDelta` will always be 0 because `originalETHBalance` already includes the `msg.value` sent by the caller. Similarly, `erc20Delta` is also computed incorrectly, leading to discrepancies in the actual delta amounts.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Missing Output Validation""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the issue of missing output validation, which is related to the incorrect calculation of `erc20Delta` and `ethDelta`. However, it does not specifically address the mathematical errors or the impact of these miscalculations, which are critical to understanding the vulnerability.

---

**[M-01] Swap.sol implements potentially dangerous transfer**

**Report Description**:
The use of `transfer()` in `Swap.sol` may have unintended outcomes when sending ETH to the receiver. If the `msg.sender` or `feeRecipient` is a smart contract, ETH may be irretrievable or undelivered if the contract fails to implement the payable fallback function or if the fallback function uses more than 2300 gas units. This can lead to lost funds.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of using `transfer()` and its potential dangers, such as gas limitations and lost funds. This is a significant oversight.

---

**[M-02] Unused ERC20 tokens are not refunded**

**Report Description**:
The current implementation only refunds ETH, leaving leftover ERC20 tokens in the contract unintentionally. This can occur when users are selling unwrapped ETH or ERC20 tokens, leading to potential loss of funds.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of unused ERC20 tokens not being refunded. This is a missed vulnerability that could lead to financial losses.

---

**[M-03] Users can avoid paying fees for ETH swaps**

**Report Description**:
Users can call `Swap.swapByQuote()` to execute an ETH swap without paying swap fees by setting `zrxBuyTokenAddress` to a malicious contract address. This tricks the system into considering the ETH as ""refunded ETH,"" allowing users to avoid fees.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Missing Fee Calculation""**.

**Validation**:
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue of missing fee calculation, which is directly related to users avoiding fees for ETH swaps. The response aligns with the reported vulnerability.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:

- **[M-03] Users can avoid paying fees for ETH swaps**

**Partially Correct Matches**:

- **[H-02] Wrong calculation of erc20Delta and ethDelta**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:

- **[H-01] Arbitrary contract call allows attackers to steal ERC20 from users' wallets**
- **[M-01] Swap.sol implements potentially dangerous transfer**
- **[M-02] Unused ERC20 tokens are not refunded**

---

### **Conclusion**

The response list partially addresses some issues but misses critical vulnerabilities such as arbitrary contract calls, dangerous use of `transfer()`, and unrefunded ERC20 tokens. These gaps indicate a need for a more comprehensive review of the code to ensure all potential risks are identified and mitigated.",1,1,3,11,"```
