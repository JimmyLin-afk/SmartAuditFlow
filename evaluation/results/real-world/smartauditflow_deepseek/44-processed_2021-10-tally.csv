When a user tries to swap unwrapped ETH to ERC20, even if there is a certain amount of ETH refunded, at L215, ethDelta will always be 0.
That's because originalETHBalance already includes the msg.value sent by the caller.
Let's say the ETH balance of the contract is 1 ETH before the swap.
A user swaps 10 ETH to USDC;
originalETHBalance will be 11 ETH;
If there is 1 ETH of refund;
ethDelta will be 0 as the new balance is 2 ETH and subOrZero(2, 11) is 0.
Similarly, erc20Delta is also computed wrong.
Consider a special case of a user trying to arbitrage from WBTC to WBTC, the originalERC20Balance already includes the input amount, erc20Delta will always be much lower than the actual delta amount.
For example, for an arb swap from 1 WBTC to 1.1 WBTC, the ethDelta will be 0.1 WBTC while it should be 1.1 WBTC.
 [M-01] Swap.sol implements potentially dangerous transfer


The use of `transfer()` in  Swap.sol may have unintended outcomes on the eth being sent to the receiver. Eth may be irretrievable or undelivered if the msg.sender or feeRecipient is a smart contract. Funds can potentially be lost if;
The smart contract fails to implement the payable fallback function
The fallback function uses more than 2300 gas units
The latter situation may occur in the instance of gas cost changes. The impact would mean that any contracts receiving funds would potentially be unable to retrieve funds from the swap.   [M-02] Unused ERC20 tokens are not refunded

Submitted by WatchPug
Based on the context and comments in the code, we assume that it's possible that there will be some leftover sell tokens, not only when users are selling unwrapped ETH but also for ERC20 tokens.
However, in the current implementation, only refunded ETH is returned (L158).
Because of this, the leftover tkoens may be left in the contract unintentionally.
 
[M-03] Users can avoid paying fees for ETH swaps

Users can call `Swap.swapByQuote()` to execute an ETH swap (where they receive ETH) without paying swap fee for the gained ETH. They can trick the system by setting zrxBuyTokenAddress to an address of a malicious contract and making it think they have executed an ERC20 swap when they have actually executed an ETH swap. In this case, the system will give them the ETH they got from the swap (boughtETHAmount) without charging any swap fees for it, because the systems consideres this ETH as ""refunded ETH"" that wasn't part of the ""ERC20"" swap.

---

#### **[H-01] Arbitrary contract call allows attackers to steal ERC20 from users' wallets**

**Report Description**:  
The `fillZrxQuote()` function in `Swap.sol` makes an arbitrary contract call with custom calldata (`zrxData`). This allows the contract to call an ERC20 token and execute `transferFrom` on a previously approved user, potentially stealing ERC20 tokens from users' wallets.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Lack of Input Validation in `fillZrxQuote` and `swapByQuote`""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the lack of input validation for `zrxTo` and `zrxData`, which is related to the issue. However, it does not explicitly mention the risk of ERC20 token theft through `transferFrom` calls, which is the core vulnerability in the issue report. The response could be improved by addressing this specific exploit scenario.

---

#### **[H-02] Wrong calculation of `erc20Delta` and `ethDelta`**

**Report Description**:  
The `fillZrxQuote()` function incorrectly calculates `erc20Delta` and `ethDelta`. For ETH swaps, `ethDelta` is always `0` because `originalETHBalance` includes the `msg.value` sent by the caller. Similarly, `erc20Delta` is miscalculated for arbitrage swaps (e.g., WBTC to WBTC), leading to incorrect delta values.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The miscalculation of `erc20Delta` and `ethDelta` is a critical flaw that could lead to incorrect token transfers and financial discrepancies. This issue should be added to the response list.

---

#### **[M-01] Swap.sol implements potentially dangerous transfer**

**Report Description**:  
The use of `transfer()` in `Swap.sol` may lead to unintended outcomes, such as irretrievable or undelivered ETH, especially if the recipient is a smart contract with a fallback function that consumes more than 2300 gas units. This could result in lost funds.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Unrestricted ETH Transfer in `swapByQuote` and `sweepFees`""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the risks associated with unrestricted ETH transfers, including the potential for lost funds due to gas limitations or malicious contracts. This aligns with the issue report's concerns.

---

#### **[M-02] Unused ERC20 tokens are not refunded**

**Report Description**:  
The current implementation of `Swap.sol` does not refund unused ERC20 tokens, leaving them unintentionally in the contract. This applies to both unwrapped ETH and ERC20 tokens.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The failure to refund unused ERC20 tokens is a medium-severity issue that could lead to financial losses for users. This issue should be added to the response list.

---

#### **[M-03] Users can avoid paying fees for ETH swaps**

**Report Description**:  
Users can exploit the `Swap.swapByQuote()` function to execute ETH swaps without paying swap fees by setting `zrxBuyTokenAddress` to a malicious contract. This tricks the system into treating the ETH swap as an ERC20 swap, allowing users to avoid fees.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The ability to bypass swap fees is a medium-severity vulnerability that could lead to financial losses for the protocol. This issue should be added to the response list.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:

- **[M-01] Swap.sol implements potentially dangerous transfer**

**Partially Correct Matches**:

- **[H-01] Arbitrary contract call allows attackers to steal ERC20 from users' wallets**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:

- **[H-02] Wrong calculation of `erc20Delta` and `ethDelta`**
- **[M-02] Unused ERC20 tokens are not refunded**
- **[M-03] Users can avoid paying fees for ETH swaps**

---

### **Recommendations**

1. **Add Missing Issues**: The response list should include the missed issues ([H-02], [M-02], [M-03]) to ensure comprehensive coverage of vulnerabilities.
2. **Improve Partial Matches**: For partially correct matches (e.g., [H-01]), provide more specific details about the exploit scenarios to better align with the issue report.
3. **Enhance Accuracy**: Ensure that all identified vulnerabilities are accurately described and validated against Solidity best practices and security standards.","```
1. Unrestricted ETH Transfer in `swapByQuote` and `sweepFees`
```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the rank of the true positive**:
   - The true positive is `Unrestricted ETH Transfer in swapByQuote and sweepFees`.
   - In the ranked list of predictions, this issue appears at **rank 2**.

2. **Calculate the precision at rank 2 (\( P@2 \))**:
   - Precision at rank \( k \) is calculated as the number of true positives up to rank \( k \) divided by \( k \).
   - Here, there is **1 true positive** up to rank 2.
   - \( P@2 = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

3. **Compute the Average Precision (AP)**:
   - Since there is only **1 true positive**, the AP is simply the precision at its rank.
   - \( AP = 0.5 \).

**Output**:
```
0.5
