MasterChef.sol#L86
When adding new token pool for staking in MasterChef contract ```
function add(address _token, uint _allocationPoints, uint16 _depositFee, uint _startBlock)
```
All other, already added, pools should be updated but currently they are not. Instead, only totalPoints is updated. Therefore, old (and not updated) pools will lose it's share during the next update. Therefore, user rewards are not computed correctly (will be always smaller).
  [H-02] Masterchef: Improper handling of deposit fee

Submitted by hickuphh3, also found by leastwood
MasterChef.sol#L170-L172
If a pool’s deposit fee is non-zero, it is subtracted from the amount to be credited to the user.
``` if (pool.depositFeeBP > 0) {
  uint depositFee = _amount.mul(pool.depositFeeBP).div(_perMille);
  user.amount = SafeCast.toUint128(user.amount + _amount - depositFee);
}
```
However, the deposit fee is not credited to anyone, leading to permanent lockups of deposit fees in the relevant depositor contracts (StakingRewards and ConvexStakingWrapper for now).

 [H-08] MasterChef.sol Users won't be able to receive the concur rewards

Submitted by WatchPug, also found by hickuphh3 and leastwood
According to:
README
Implementation of deposit(): /contracts/MasterChef.sol#L157-L180
MasterChef is only recording the deposited amount in the states, it's not actually holding the depositToken.
depositToken won't be transferred from _msgSender() to the MasterChef contract.
Therefore, in updatePool() L140 lpSupply = pool.depositToken.balanceOf(address(this)) will always be 0. And the updatePool() will be returned at L147.
  [H-09] deposit in ConvexStakingWrapper will most certainly revert

Submitted by wuwe1, also found by WatchPug
ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L94-L99
        address mainPool = IRewardStaking(convexBooster)
            .poolInfo(_pid)
            .crvRewards;
        if (rewards[_pid].length == 0) {
            pids[IRewardStaking(convexBooster).poolInfo(_pid).lptoken] = _pid;
            convexPool[_pid] = mainPool;

convexPool[_pid] is set to IRewardStaking(convexBooster).poolInfo(_pid).crvRewards;
crvRewards is a BaseRewardPool like this one: https://etherscan.io/address/0x8B55351ea358e5Eda371575B031ee24F462d503e#code.
BaseRewardPool does not implement poolInfo
ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L238
IRewardStaking(convexPool[_pid]).poolInfo(_pid).lptoken

Above line calls poolInfo of crvRewards which causes revert.
  [M-02] Unconstrained fee

Submitted by Czar102, also found by defsec, Dravee, harleythedog, hickuphh3, and throttle
MasterChef.sol#L86-L101
Token fee in MasterChef can be set to more than 100%, (for example, by accident) causing all deposit calls to fail due to underflow on subtraction when reward is lowered by the fee, thus breaking essential mechanics. Note that after the fee has been set to any value, it cannot be undone. A token cannot be removed, added, or added the second time. Thus, mistakenly (or deliberately, maliciously) added fee that is larger than 100% will make the contract impossible to recover from not being able to use the token.
  [M-20] MasterChef.updatePool() Fails To Update Reward Variables If block.number >= endBlock

Submitted by leastwood, also found by CertoraInc, csanuragjain, Czar102, hickuphh3, kirk-baird, and WatchPug
The updatePool function intends to calculate the accumulated Concur rewards by tracking the number of blocks passed since the last update to correctly determine how many Concur tokens to distribute to each share. The reward distribution has a start and end block which dictates the timeframe by which rewards will be distributed to the underlying pool.
If a pool has not recently updated itself and has reached the block.number >= endBlock statement in updatePool, then any rewards that it would normally be entitled to prior to reaching endBlock will not be attributed to the pool. Therefore, once rewards are no longer being distributed, pools who had not recently called updatePool before reaching endBlock are at a disadvantage as compared to more active pools.

### **Detailed Analysis**

---

**[H-01] Wrong reward token calculation in MasterChef contract**

**Report Description**:
When adding a new token pool for staking in the MasterChef contract, the `add` function updates only `totalPoints` but fails to update the allocation points of existing pools. This oversight causes old pools to lose their share during the next update, leading to incorrect user reward calculations. As a result, user rewards will always be smaller than expected.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue at all. The problem of incorrect reward token calculation due to unupdated allocation points is entirely missed.

---

**[H-02] Masterchef: Improper handling of deposit fee**

**Report Description**:
If a pool’s deposit fee is non-zero, it is subtracted from the amount to be credited to the user. However, the deposit fee is not credited to anyone, leading to permanent lockups of deposit fees in the relevant depositor contracts (StakingRewards and ConvexStakingWrapper). This results in a loss of funds for users and potential economic inefficiencies.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of improper handling of deposit fees, leading to permanent lockups of funds.

---

**[H-08] MasterChef.sol Users won't be able to receive the concur rewards**

**Report Description**:
The `deposit` function in MasterChef only records the deposited amount in the state but does not actually transfer the `depositToken` from the user to the contract. As a result, `lpSupply = pool.depositToken.balanceOf(address(this))` will always be `0`, causing the `updatePool` function to return early. This prevents users from receiving `concur` rewards.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue, which prevents users from receiving rewards due to incorrect token handling.

---

**[H-09] deposit in ConvexStakingWrapper will most certainly revert**

**Report Description**:
The `ConvexStakingWrapper` contract sets `convexPool[_pid]` to `IRewardStaking(convexBooster).poolInfo(_pid).crvRewards`. However, `crvRewards` is a `BaseRewardPool` that does not implement the `poolInfo` function. This causes a revert when `poolInfo` is called on `crvRewards`, making the `deposit` function fail.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue, which causes a revert due to an unimplemented function call.

---

**[M-02] Unconstrained fee**

**Report Description**:
The token fee in MasterChef can be set to more than 100%, causing all `deposit` calls to fail due to underflow on subtraction when the reward is lowered by the fee. This breaks essential contract mechanics. Once the fee is set to an invalid value, it cannot be undone, making the contract impossible to recover from.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of unconstrained fees, which can lead to contract failure and unrecoverable states.

---

**[M-20] MasterChef.updatePool() Fails To Update Reward Variables If block.number >= endBlock**

**Report Description**:
The `updatePool` function fails to update reward variables if `block.number >= endBlock`. Pools that have not recently updated themselves before reaching `endBlock` will not receive rewards they are entitled to, putting them at a disadvantage compared to more active pools.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue, which leads to unfair reward distribution for inactive pools.

---

### **Conclusion**

The `response_list` does not address any of the issues in the `issue` report. All issues are either **incorrectly matched** or **missed entirely**. This indicates a significant gap in the coverage, accuracy, and sufficiency of the responses provided. The response list focuses on unrelated issues, such as uninitialized state variables, division by zero, and unchecked external calls, which do not align with the vulnerabilities and risks described in the `issue` report.","```

Submitted by mtz, also found by 0x1f8b, 0xliumin, bitbopper, cccz, cmichel, csanuragjain, Czar102, danb, Alex the Entreprenerd, GeekyLumberjack, gzeon, hickuphh3, hyh, leastwood, Randyyy, Rhynorater, Ruhum, and ShadowyNoobDev
Shelter.sol#L52-L57
tl;dr Anyone who can call `withdraw` to withdraw their own funds can call it repeatedly to withdraw the funds of others. withdraw should only succeed if the user hasn't withdrawn the token already.
The shelter can be used for users to withdraw funds in the event of an emergency. The withdraw function allows callers to withdraw tokens based on the tokens they have deposited into the shelter client: ConvexStakingWrapper. However, withdraw does not check if a user has already withdrawn their tokens. Thus a user that can withdraw tokens, can call withdraw repeatedly to steal the tokens of others.
  [H-07] Shelter claimed mapping is set with _to address and not msg.sender

Function `withdraw()`, claimed[_token][_to] 
Any user can withdraw all the funds from the shelter. This is done by calling withdraw repeatedly until all funds are drained. You only need to have a small share.
Even if the claimed mapping was checked, there would still be a vulnerability. This is because the claimed mapping is updated with the _to address, not the msg.sender address.
  [M-01] Deposits after the grace period should not be allowed

Submitted by pauliax
Shelter.sol#L34 Shelter.sol#L54
Function donate in Shelter shouldn't allow new deposits after the grace period ends, when the claim period begins. Otherwise, it will be possible to increase savedTokens[_token], and thus new user claim amounts will increase after some users might already have withdrawn their shares.
  [M-07] Fee-on-transfer token donations in Shelter break withdrawals

Submitted by cmichel, also found by Dravee, IllIllI, and Ruhum
Shelter.sol#L34
The Sheler.donate function transferFroms _amount and adds the entire _amount to savedTokens[_token]. But the actual received token amount from the transfer can be less for fee-on-transfer tokens.
The last person to withdraw will not be able to as withdraw uses a share computation for the entire savedTokens[_token] amount. The calculated amount will then be higher than the actual contract balance.
function donate(IERC20 _token, uint256 _amount) external {
    require(activated[_token] != 0, ""!activated"");
    savedTokens[_token] += _amount;
    // @audit fee-on-transfer. then fails for last person in `withdraw`
    _token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
}

function withdraw(IERC20 _token, address _to) external override {
    // @audit percentage on storage var, not on actual balance
    uint256 amount = savedTokens[_token] * client.shareOf(_token, msg.sender) / client.totalShare(_token);
    // @audit amount might not be in contract anymore as savedTokens[_token] is over-reported
    _token.safeTransfer(_to, amount);
}  [M-08] Donated Tokens Cannot Be Recovered If A Shelter Is Deactivated

Submitted by leastwood, also found by reassor
The shelter mechanism can be activated and deactivated on a target LP token. The owner of the ConvexStakingWrapper.sol contract can initiate the shelter whereby LP tokens are sent to the Shelter.sol contract. However, if the owner decides to deactivate the shelter before the grace period has passed, all LP tokens are transferred back to the ConvexStakingWrapper.sol contract. Donated tokens are also sent back to the contract. As a result, these tokens do not actually belong to any user and will effectively be lost in the contract.

**Report Description**:
The `withdraw` function in `Shelter.sol` allows users to withdraw tokens based on their deposited amount. However, it does not check if a user has already withdrawn their tokens. This oversight enables a user to repeatedly call `withdraw` to drain the funds of others. Additionally, the `claimed` mapping is updated with the `_to` address instead of `msg.sender`, further exacerbating the issue. This vulnerability could lead to significant financial loss as malicious users can exploit this to steal tokens.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential Reentrancy in `withdraw` Function""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the risk of reentrancy in the `withdraw` function, which is related to the issue of repeated withdrawals. However, it misses the critical detail that the `claimed` mapping is updated with the `_to` address instead of `msg.sender`, which is a key part of the vulnerability. The response also does not explicitly mention the ability to drain funds from other users.

---

### **[H-07] Shelter `claimed` mapping is set with `_to` address and not `msg.sender`**

**Report Description**:
The `claimed` mapping in the `withdraw` function is updated with the `_to` address instead of `msg.sender`. This allows any user to withdraw all funds from the shelter by repeatedly calling `withdraw` until all funds are drained. Even if the `claimed` mapping was checked, the vulnerability would still exist due to this incorrect mapping update.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of the `claimed` mapping being updated with the `_to` address instead of `msg.sender`. This is a critical vulnerability that allows users to drain funds from the shelter, and it is not covered in the response list.

---

### **[M-01] Deposits after the grace period should not be allowed**

**Report Description**:
The `donate` function in `Shelter.sol` allows new deposits after the grace period ends, which is when the claim period begins. This can lead to an increase in `savedTokens[_token]`, causing new user claim amounts to increase after some users have already withdrawn their shares. This behavior can result in unfair distribution of tokens and potential financial discrepancies.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of allowing deposits after the grace period. This is a medium-severity issue that can lead to unfair token distribution and is not covered in the response list.

---

### **[M-07] Fee-on-transfer token donations in Shelter break withdrawals**

**Report Description**:
The `Shelter.donate` function adds the entire `_amount` to `savedTokens[_token]` after transferring tokens. However, for fee-on-transfer tokens, the actual received amount can be less than `_amount`. This discrepancy causes the last person to withdraw to fail, as the calculated withdrawal amount will be higher than the actual contract balance.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of fee-on-transfer tokens causing discrepancies in `savedTokens[_token]`. This is a medium-severity issue that can lead to failed withdrawals and is not covered in the response list.

---

### **[M-08] Donated Tokens Cannot Be Recovered If A Shelter Is Deactivated**

**Report Description**:
If the shelter is deactivated before the grace period ends, all LP tokens, including donated tokens, are transferred back to the `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol` contract. Since these donated tokens do not belong to any user, they are effectively lost in the contract, leading to potential financial loss.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of donated tokens being lost if the shelter is deactivated before the grace period ends. This is a medium-severity issue that can lead to financial loss and is not covered in the response list.

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:
- **[H-03] Repeated Calls to Shelter.withdraw Can Drain All Funds in Shelter**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:
- **[H-07] Shelter `claimed` mapping is set with `_to` address and not `msg.sender`**
- **[M-01] Deposits after the grace period should not be allowed**
- **[M-07] Fee-on-transfer token donations in Shelter break withdrawals**
- **[M-08] Donated Tokens Cannot Be Recovered If A Shelter Is Deactivated**

---

The response list partially addresses one issue but misses several critical vulnerabilities, particularly those related to the `claimed` mapping, fee-on-transfer tokens, and the grace period logic. These gaps indicate a need for more comprehensive coverage of the issues in the `issue` report.","```

function `_calcRewardIntegral()`   [H-10] ConvexStakingWrapper.exitShelter() Will Lock LP Tokens, Preventing Users From Withdrawing

Submitted by leastwood
The shelter mechanism provides emergency functionality in an effort to protect users' funds. The enterShelter function will withdraw all LP tokens from the pool, transfer them to the shelter contract and activate the shelter for the target LP token. Conversely, the exitShelter function will deactivate the shelter and transfer all LP tokens back to the ConvexStakingWrapper.sol contract.
Unfortunately, LP tokens aren't restaked in the pool, causing LP tokens to be stuck within the contract. Users will be unable to withdraw their LP tokens as the withdraw function attempts to withdrawAndUnwrap LP tokens from the staking pool. As a result, this function will always revert due to insufficient staked balance. If other users decide to deposit their LP tokens, then these tokens can be swiped by users who have had their LP tokens locked in the contract.
This guarantees poor UX for the protocol and will most definitely lead to LP token loss.
  [H-11] ConvexStakingWrapper._calcRewardIntegral() Can Be Manipulated To Steal Tokens From Other Pools

Submitted by leastwood, also found by cmichel and kirk-baird
The ConvexStakingWrapper.sol implementation makes several modifications to the original design. One of the key changes is the ability to add multiple pools into the wrapper contract, where each pool is represented by a unique _pid. By doing this, we are able to aggregate pools and their LP tokens to simplify the token distribution process.
However, the interdependence between pools introduces new problems. Because the original implementation uses the contract's reward token balance to track newly claimed tokens, it is possible for a malicious user to abuse the unguarded getReward function to maximise the profit they are able to generate. By calling getReward on multiple pools with the same reward token (i.e. cvx), users are able to siphon rewards from other pools. This inevitably leads to certain loss of rewards for users who have deposited LP tokens into these victim pools. As crv and cvx are reward tokens by default, it is very likely that someone will want to exploit this issue.
  [M-11] ConvexStakingWrapper.enterShelter() May Erroneously Overwrite amountInShelter Leading To Locked Tokens

Submitted by leastwood
The shelter mechanism provides emergency functionality in an effort to protect users' funds. The enterShelter function will withdraw all LP tokens from the pool, transfer them to the shelter contract and activate the shelter for the target LP token. If this function is called again on the same LP token, the amountInShelter value is overwritten, potentially by the zero amount. As a result its possible that the shelter is put in a state where no users can withdraw from it or only a select few users with a finite number of shares are able to. Once the shelter has passed its grace period, these tokens may forever be locked in the shelter contract.

  [M-14] Owner can steal Concur rewards

Submitted by Czar102
MasterChef.sol#L78-L80 MasterChef.sol#L157-L180
Owner can steal Concur rewards by adding a depositor and inflating other depositors' assigned balance of the token within the contract. Thus, the owner-managed depositor can get most (all but one wei) of the created tokens.
  [M-15] Owner can lock tokens in MasterChef

Submitted by Czar102, also found by csanuragjain and Jujic
MasterChef.sol#L82-L84
Owner can remove a depositor. Since only depositors can deposit and withdraw, the owner may add a contract to the whitelist, let users deposit in the contract and remove the depositor from the whitelist. Depositor's reward cannot be withdrawn then. And takes a share of Concur tokens that will not be distributed.
  [M-16] Rewards get diluted because totalAllocPoint can only increase.

Submitted by throttle
MasterChef.sol
There is no functionality for removing pools/setting pool's allocPoints. Therefore totalAllocPoint only increases and rewards for pool decreases.

**Report Description**:
The `deposit()` function in `ConvexStakingWrapper` and `StakingRewards` uses `masterChef.deposit()`, which takes `_msgSender()` as the user address. However, `_msgSender()` is the address of `ConvexStakingWrapper` and `StakingRewards`, not the actual user. This misimplementation causes `concur` rewards to be sent to the wrong receiver, leading to incorrect reward distribution and potential loss of rewards for users.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of incorrect reward distribution due to the misuse of `_msgSender()` in `masterChef.deposit()`. This is a critical issue that is entirely missed in the response list.

---

### **[H-06] ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#_calcRewardIntegral Wrong implementation can disrupt rewards calculation and distribution**

**Report Description**:
The `_calcRewardIntegral()` function in `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol` has a flawed implementation that can disrupt the calculation and distribution of rewards. This could lead to incorrect reward allocations, potentially causing users to receive fewer rewards than they are entitled to.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential Integer Overflow/Underflow in Reward Calculations""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies potential integer overflow/underflow in reward calculations, which is related to the issue. However, it does not address the broader problem of incorrect reward distribution logic in `_calcRewardIntegral()`, which is the core issue in the report.

---

### **[H-10] ConvexStakingWrapper.exitShelter() Will Lock LP Tokens, Preventing Users From Withdrawing**

**Report Description**:
The `exitShelter()` function in `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol` does not restake LP tokens back into the pool after transferring them from the shelter contract. This oversight causes LP tokens to be stuck in the contract, preventing users from withdrawing their funds. If other users deposit LP tokens, these tokens can be swiped by users whose tokens are locked, leading to poor UX and potential loss of LP tokens.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of LP tokens being locked due to the failure to restake them in the pool. This is a critical issue that is entirely missed in the response list.

---

### **[H-11] ConvexStakingWrapper._calcRewardIntegral() Can Be Manipulated To Steal Tokens From Other Pools**

**Report Description**:
The `_calcRewardIntegral()` function in `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol` can be manipulated by malicious users to siphon rewards from other pools. By calling `getReward` on multiple pools with the same reward token (e.g., `cvx`), users can maximize their profits at the expense of other users, leading to loss of rewards for those who deposited LP tokens into victim pools.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential Front-Running in Reward Calculation or Withdraw Requests""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the potential for front-running in reward calculations, which is related to the issue. However, it does not address the specific manipulation of `_calcRewardIntegral()` to steal tokens from other pools, which is the core issue in the report.

---

### **[M-11] ConvexStakingWrapper.enterShelter() May Erroneously Overwrite amountInShelter Leading To Locked Tokens**

**Report Description**:
The `enterShelter()` function in `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol` overwrites the `amountInShelter` value when called multiple times on the same LP token. This could lead to the shelter being in a state where users cannot withdraw their tokens, potentially locking them in the shelter contract permanently.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of `amountInShelter` being erroneously overwritten, leading to locked tokens. This is a critical issue that is entirely missed in the response list.

---

### **[M-14] Owner can steal Concur rewards**

**Report Description**:
The owner of `MasterChef.sol` can steal `Concur` rewards by adding a depositor and inflating other depositors' assigned balance of the token within the contract. This allows the owner-managed depositor to receive most (all but one wei) of the created tokens.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of the owner being able to steal `Concur` rewards by manipulating depositor balances. This is a critical issue that is entirely missed in the response list.

---

### **[M-15] Owner can lock tokens in MasterChef**

**Report Description**:
The owner of `MasterChef.sol` can remove a depositor from the whitelist, preventing users from withdrawing their tokens. If the owner adds a contract to the whitelist, lets users deposit, and then removes the depositor, the tokens and rewards become locked, leading to potential loss of funds.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of the owner being able to lock tokens by removing depositors from the whitelist. This is a critical issue that is entirely missed in the response list.

---

### **[M-16] Rewards get diluted because totalAllocPoint can only increase**

**Report Description**:
In `MasterChef.sol`, there is no functionality to remove pools or set a pool's `allocPoints`. As a result, `totalAllocPoint` can only increase, leading to the dilution of rewards for existing pools.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of reward dilution due to the inability to decrease `totalAllocPoint`. This is a critical issue that is entirely missed in the response list.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:
- **[H-06] ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#_calcRewardIntegral Wrong implementation can disrupt rewards calculation and distribution**

ConvexStakingWrapper, StakingRewards is using masterChef.deposit(), masterChef.withdraw(), and these two functions on masterChef will take _msgSender() as the user address, which is actually the address of ConvexStakingWrapper and StakingRewards.

  [M-09] StakingRewards.sol#notifyRewardAmount() Improper reward balance checks can make some users unable to withdraw their rewards

Submitted by WatchPug

    uint256 balance = rewardsToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    require(
        rewardRate <= balance / rewardsDuration,
        ""Provided reward too high""
    );

In the current implementation, the contract only checks if balanceOf rewardsToken is greater than or equal to the future rewards.
However, under normal circumstances, since users can not withdraw all their rewards in time, the balance in the contract contains rewards that belong to the users but have not been withdrawn yet. This means the current checks can not be sufficient enough to make sure the contract has enough amount of rewardsToken.
As a result, if the rewardsDistribution mistakenly notifyRewardAmount with a larger amount, the contract may end up in a wrong state that makes some users unable to claim their rewards.
  [M-13] StakingRewards.recoverERC20 allows owner to rug the rewardsToken

Submitted by Alex the Entreprenerd, also found by pauliax
StakingRewards.sol#L166
StakingRewards.recoverERC20 rightfully checks against the stakingToken being sweeped away. However, there's no check against the rewardsToken which over time will sit in this contract.
This is the case of an admin privilege, which allows the owner to sweep the rewards tokens, perhaps as a way to rug depositors.
Proof of Concept

Calling StakingRewards.recoverERC20(rewardsToken, rewardsToken.balanceOf(this)) enables the owner to sweep the token.

**Report Description**:
The `deposit()` function in `ConvexStakingWrapper` and `StakingRewards` uses `masterChef.deposit()` and `masterChef.withdraw()`, which take `_msgSender()` as the user address. However, `_msgSender()` returns the address of `ConvexStakingWrapper` and `StakingRewards` instead of the actual user. This misimplementation can lead to concur rewards being sent to the wrong receiver, causing incorrect reward distribution and potential financial loss.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this specific issue. The problem of incorrect reward distribution due to the misuse of `_msgSender()` is not covered in any of the responses.

### **[M-06] StakingRewards.sol recoverERC20() can be used as a backdoor by the owner to retrieve rewardsToken**

**Report Description**:
The `recoverERC20()` function in `StakingRewards.sol` allows the owner to retrieve any ERC20 token except the staking token. However, it does not check against the `rewardsToken`, which could allow the owner to rug pull the rewards token, leading to potential loss of funds for users.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Unrestricted `recoverERC20` Function""**.

**Validation**:
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue with the `recoverERC20` function, noting that it allows the owner to recover any ERC20 token except the staking token. This aligns with the reported issue, where the owner could potentially rug pull the rewards token.

---

### **[M-09] StakingRewards.sol#notifyRewardAmount() Improper reward balance checks can make some users unable to withdraw their rewards**

**Report Description**:
The `notifyRewardAmount()` function in `StakingRewards.sol` checks if the `rewardRate` is less than or equal to the balance of `rewardsToken` divided by `rewardsDuration`. However, this check is insufficient because the contract's balance includes rewards that belong to users but have not been withdrawn yet. If the `rewardsDistribution` mistakenly notifies a larger reward amount, the contract may end up in a state where some users cannot claim their rewards.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Insufficient Balance Check in `notifyRewardAmount`""**.

**Validation**:
**Correct**. The response correctly identifies the issue with insufficient balance checks in the `notifyRewardAmount` function, noting that the contract may become insolvent if it promises more rewards than it can distribute. This aligns with the reported issue.

### **[M-13] StakingRewards.recoverERC20 allows owner to rug the rewardsToken**

**Report Description**:
The `recoverERC20()` function in `StakingRewards.sol` allows the owner to retrieve any ERC20 token except the staking token. However, it does not check against the `rewardsToken`, which could allow the owner to rug pull the rewards token, leading to potential loss of funds for users.

**Match in Response List**:

Submitted by Alex the Entreprenerd, also found by gzeon, IllIllI, and leastwood
USDMPegRecovery.sol#L90 USDMPegRecovery.sol#L110 USDMPegRecovery.sol#L73 USDMPegRecovery.sol#L84
In USDMPegRecovery deposit and withdraw allow for direct deposits of a specific token (3crv or usdm).
The balances are directly changed and tracked in storage.
provide seems to be using the real balances (not the ones store) to provide liquidity. Because of how curve works, you'll be able (first deposit) to provide exactly matching liquidity. But after (even just 1 or) multiple swaps, the pool will be slightly imbalanced, adding or removing liquidity at that point will drastically change the balances in the contract from the ones tracked in storage.
Eventually users won't be able to withdraw the exact amounts they deposited.
This will culminate with real balances not matching user deposits, sometimes to user advantage and other times to user disadvantage, ultimately to the protocol dismay.
  [M-03] USDMPegRecovery.sol#withdraw() withdraw may often fail

Submitted by WatchPug
Per the doc:
USDM deposits are locked based on the KPI’s from carrot.eth.
3Crv deposits are not locked.
USDMPegRecovery.sol#L110-L128
function withdraw(Liquidity calldata _withdrawal) external {
        Liquidity memory total = totalLiquidity;
        Liquidity memory user = userLiquidity[msg.sender];

            require(unlockable, ""!unlock usdm"");
            usdm.safeTransfer(msg.sender, uint256(_withdrawal.usdm));
            total.usdm -= _withdrawal.usdm;
            user.usdm -= _withdrawal.usdm;
        }

        if(_withdrawal.pool3 > 0) {
            pool3.safeTransfer(msg.sender, uint256(_withdrawal.pool3));

        totalLiquidity = total;
        userLiquidity[msg.sender] = user;
        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, _withdrawal);
    }

However, because the withdraw() function takes funds from the balance of the contract, once the majority of the funds are added to the curve pool via provide(). The withdraw() may often fail due to insufficient funds in the balance.
  [M-04] USDMPegRecovery.sol#provide() Improper design/implementation make it often unable to add liquidity to the usdm3crv pool

Submitted by WatchPug
USDMPegRecovery.sol#L73-L82
function provide(uint256 _minimumLP) external onlyGuardian {
    require(usdm.balanceOf(address(this)) >= totalLiquidity.usdm, ""<liquidity"");
    // truncate amounts under step
    uint256 addingLiquidity = (usdm.balanceOf(address(this)) / step) * step;

    pool3.approve(address(usdm3crv), addingLiquidity);
    usdm3crv.add_liquidity(amounts, _minimumLP);
}

In the current implementation of USDMPegRecovery.sol#provide(), addingLiquidity is calculated solely based on usdm balance (truncate at a step of 250k), and it always uses the same amount of 3pool tokens to add_liquidity with.
Based on other functions of the contract, the balance of usdm can usually be more than the pool3 balance, in that case, usdm3crv.add_liquidity() will fail.
  [M-05] USDM locked unless guardian remove liquidity

Submitted by gzeon
In README.me:
USDM deposits are locked based on the KPI’s from carrot.eth
However, USDM deposits are also locked until guardian remove liquidity because there are no mechanism to remove deposited USDM in withdraw.
USDMPegRecovery.sol#L90
  [M-12] USDMPegRecovery.provide() Will Fail If There Is An Excess Of usdm Tokens

Submitted by leastwood
The provide function does not take a _steps argument and will instead calculate addingLiquidity by truncating amounts under step. As a result, if there is an excess of usdm such that the truncated amount exceeds the contract's pool3 truncated balance, then the function will revert due to insufficient pool3 collateral.
This will prevent guardians from effectively providing liquidity whenever tokens are available. Consider the following example:
The contract has 500000e18 usdm tokens and 250000e18 pool3 tokens.
addingLiquidity will be calculated as 500000e18 / 250000e18 * 250000e18.
The function will attempt to add 500000e18 usdm and pool3 tokens in which there are insufficient pool3 tokens in the contract. As a result, it will revert even though there is an abundance of tokens that satisfy the step amount.

}",380.6178860664368,43885.0,24.0,"### **[H-05] USDMPegRecovery Risk of Fund Locked, Due to Discrepancy Between CurveLP Token Value Against Internal Contract Math**

**Report Description**:  
The `USDMPegRecovery` contract allows direct deposits of `3crv` or `usdm` tokens, with balances tracked in storage. However, the `provide` function uses real balances (not stored balances) to add liquidity to the Curve pool. Due to Curve's mechanics, the pool can become imbalanced after swaps, leading to discrepancies between the contract's stored balances and the actual balances. This can result in users being unable to withdraw their exact deposited amounts, potentially locking funds or causing losses to the protocol.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of discrepancies between stored balances and actual balances in the Curve pool, nor does it mention the risk of fund locking due to this mismatch. This is a critical oversight, as it directly impacts the contract's functionality and user funds.

---

### **[M-03] USDMPegRecovery.sol#withdraw() Withdraw May Often Fail**

**Report Description**:  
The `withdraw` function in `USDMPegRecovery.sol` transfers funds from the contract's balance. However, once most funds are added to the Curve pool via the `provide` function, the contract's balance may be insufficient to fulfill withdrawal requests. This can cause the `withdraw` function to fail frequently, preventing users from accessing their funds.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of insufficient contract balances causing withdrawal failures. This is a significant functional flaw that directly impacts user experience and fund accessibility.

---

### **[M-04] USDMPegRecovery.sol#provide() Improper Design/Implementation Make It Often Unable to Add Liquidity to the usdm3crv Pool**

**Report Description**:  
The `provide` function calculates `addingLiquidity` based solely on the `usdm` balance, truncating it at a step of 250k. It then attempts to add an equal amount of `pool3` tokens to the Curve pool. However, if the `usdm` balance exceeds the `pool3` balance, the function will fail due to insufficient `pool3` tokens. This design flaw prevents the contract from effectively adding liquidity to the Curve pool.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of improper liquidity provisioning due to mismatched token balances. This is a critical design flaw that hinders the contract's ability to function as intended.

---

### **[M-05] USDM Locked Unless Guardian Removes Liquidity**

**Report Description**:  
The `USDMPegRecovery` contract locks `usdm` deposits based on KPI metrics from `carrot.eth`. However, there is no mechanism to remove deposited `usdm` in the `withdraw` function unless the guardian removes liquidity from the Curve pool. This effectively locks `usdm` deposits until the guardian intervenes, creating a potential bottleneck and risk for users.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of `usdm` deposits being locked due to the lack of a withdrawal mechanism. This is a significant oversight that impacts user fund accessibility.

---

### **[M-12] USDMPegRecovery.provide() Will Fail If There Is An Excess Of usdm Tokens**

**Report Description**:  
The `provide` function calculates `addingLiquidity` by truncating the `usdm` balance under a step value. If the truncated `usdm` amount exceeds the contract's `pool3` balance, the function will revert due to insufficient `pool3` tokens. This prevents guardians from providing liquidity even when tokens are available, as the function does not account for mismatched balances.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of liquidity provisioning failures due to mismatched token balances. This is a critical flaw that limits the contract's functionality.
