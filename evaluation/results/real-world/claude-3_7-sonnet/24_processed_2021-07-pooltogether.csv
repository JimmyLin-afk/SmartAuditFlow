}",3524,331,"[H-01] `onlyOwnerOrAssetManager` can swap Yield Source in SwappableYieldSource at any time, immediately rugging all funds from old yield source
The function `swapYieldSource` SwappableYieldSource.sol` L307
Can be called by the owner (deployer / initializer) or Asset Manager. The function will take all funds from the old Yield Source, and transfer them to the new Yield source. Any contract that implement the function function depositToken() external returns (address) will pass the check
However, if either the owner or the `assetManager` have malicious intent, this function allows them to instantly rug all funds

[H-02] redeemToken can fail for certain tokens
The `SwappableYieldSource.redeemToken` function transfers tokens from the contract back to the sender, however, it uses the `ERC20.transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, redeemableBalance)` function for this. Some deposit token implementations might fail as transferFrom checks if the contract approved itself for the redeemableBalance instead of skipping the allowance check in case the sender is the from address.

[H-03] setYieldSource leads to temporary wrong results
The use of `setYieldSource` leaves the contract in a temporary inconsistent state because it changes the underlying yield source, but doesn't (yet) transfer the underlying balances, while the shares stay the same.
The function `balanceOfToken` will show the wrong results, because it is based on `_sharesToToken`, which uses yieldSource.balanceOfToken(address(this)), that isn't updated yet.

[H-04] SwappableYieldSource: Missing same deposit token check in transferFunds()`transferFunds()` will transfer funds from a specified yield source _yieldSource to the current yield source set in the contract _currentYieldSource. However, it fails to check that the deposit tokens are the same. If the specified yield source's assets are of a higher valuation, then a malicious owner or asset manager will be able to exploit and pocket the difference.

[M-01] Single-step process for critical ownership transfer/renounce is riskyThe `SwappableYieldSource` allows owners and asset managers to set/swap/transfer yield sources/funds. As such, the contract ownership plays a critical role in the protocol.
Given that `AssetManager` is derived from `Ownable`, the ownership management of this contract defaults to `Ownable`’s `transferOwnership()` and `renounceOwnership()` methods which are not overridden here. Such critical address transfer/renouncing in one-step is very risky because it is irrecoverable from any mistakes.

[M-02] Use of `safeApprove` will always cause `approveMax` to revert
Unlike SwappableYieldSource which uses safeIncreaseAllowance to increase the allowance to uint256.max, mStableYieldSource uses OpenZeppelin’s safeApprove() which has been documented as (1) Deprecated because of approve-like race condition and (2) To be used only for initial setting of allowance (current allowance == 0) or resetting to 0 because it reverts otherwise.
The usage here is intended to allow increase of allowance when it falls low similar to the documented usage in SwappableYieldSource. Using it for that scenario will not work as expected because it will always revert if current allowance is != 0. The initial allowance is already set as uint256.max in constructor. And once it gets reduced, it can never be increased using this function unless it is invoked when allowance is reduced completely to 0. See issue page for referenced code.

[M-03] Inconsistent balance when supplying transfer-on-fee or deflationary tokens
The `supplyTokenTo` function of SwappableYieldSource assumes that amount of _depositToken is transferred to itself after calling the safeTransferFrom function (and thus it supplies amount of token to the yield source). However, this may not be true if the _depositToken is a transfer-on-fee token or a deflationary/rebasing token, causing the received amount to be less than the accounted amount. SwappableYieldSource.sol L211-L212[M-04] Old yield source still has infinite approvalAfter swapping a yield source, the old yield source still has infinite approval. Infinite approval has been used in large attacks if the yield source isn't perfectly safe (see furucombo).",8,"pragma solidity 0.7.6;

Let's analyze this contract for potential vulnerabilities:

1. The `_requireYieldSource` has some logic issues:
   - It checks for `isInvalidYieldSource = depositTokenAddress != address(0);`
   - But then requires that `isInvalidYieldSource` is true, which means it's requiring that the deposit token address is NOT the zero address
   - This is fine, but the naming and logic is a bit confusing

2. In `initialize()`, there's a proper check that the owner is not the zero address, but no similar check for the yieldSource itself

3. In `approveMaxAmount()`, there's an approval for the maximum amount (type(uint256).max), which could be problematic if the token contract has known issues with approvals

4. The `_burnShares` function calculates the shares to burn but doesn't check if the caller has enough shares to burn

5. In `redeemToken`, it calls `_burnShares` which burns the shares, but doesn't check if the user has enough tokens to redeem the amount requested

6. The `_transferFunds` function calls `_yieldSource.redeemToken(_amount)` and then checks if `_amount <= currentBalance`. This check might not be reliable because the actual redemption might return a different amount than requested

7. In `transferERC20`, it prevents transferring tokens from the yieldSource, but it doesn't check if the token being transferred is the deposit token

8. The contract doesn't check if the YieldSource implementation actually supports the methods being called (like `balanceOfToken`, `redeemToken`, etc.)

9. In `_setupDecimals(_decimals)`, there's a check that `_decimals > 0`, but ERC20 tokens commonly have 0 decimals, so this might unnecessarily restrict some tokens

10. In the `initialize` function, it approves the maximum amount to the yield source contract, which could be exploitable if the yield source contract is compromised

11. The contract inherits from both OwnableUpgradeable (through AssetManager) and ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable, but it doesn't explicitly call the initializers for all base contracts, which could lead to uninitialized state variables
</think># Vulnerabilities in SwappableYieldSource Contract

1. **Logic Error in `_requireYieldSource` Function:**
   - The validation logic has an issue. It sets `isInvalidYieldSource` when the deposit token address is not zero, but then requires that `isInvalidYieldSource` is true. This appears backward - it should either use a better variable name or invert the logic.

2. **Incorrect Staticcall Implementation:**
   - In `_requireYieldSource`, the static call uses `abi.encode` for the selector, but should use `abi.encodeWithSelector`. This will result in incorrectly formed function calls.

3. **Issues with Yield Source Verification:**
   - The validation logic for checking a valid yield source is flawed. It's trying to check if the deposit token is not zero, but the implementation is convoluted and potentially incorrect.

4. **Unlimited Token Approvals:**
   - The contract approves `type(uint256).max` tokens to the yield source in both `initialize` and when setting a new yield source, which creates a significant security risk if the yield source is ever compromised.

5. **Missing Return Value Checks:**
   - The contract doesn't check the return values from external calls to the yield source, potentially missing failed operations.

6. **Inconsistent Fund Handling:**
   - In `_transferFunds`, the function assumes that `_amount` will be equal to the balance after redemption, but there's no guarantee that `redeemToken` returns exactly the requested amount.

7. **Decimals Validation Issue:**
   - The contract requires `_decimals > 0` in the initialize function, but valid ERC20 tokens can have 0 decimals.

8. **Re-entrancy Risk in Token Operations:**
   - While the contract uses ReentrancyGuard, not all external calls are protected. For example, `transferERC20` lacks nonReentrant modifier.

9. **Incomplete Initialization:**
   - The contract has a `freeze()` function marked as initializer but it doesn't perform any actions, which is suspicious and possibly incomplete.

10. **Lack of Event Emission in Critical Functions:**
    - Some important state-changing functions like `redeemToken` don't emit events, making it difficult to track actions on the blockchain.

11. **Poor Error Handling:**
    - The error messages are not specific enough in several functions, making debugging and issue tracing difficult.

12. **Missing Deposit Token Verification:**
    - When transferring ERC20 tokens in `transferERC20`, it only checks if the token is not the yield source itself, but doesn't verify if it's the deposit token, which could lead to unintended loss of funds.

13. **Potential for Precision Loss in Share Calculations:**
    - The calculations in `_tokenToShares` and `_sharesToToken` could lead to precision loss in certain scenarios.","### **Analysis of Issues and Responses**

---

#### **[H-01] `onlyOwnerOrAssetManager` can swap Yield Source in `SwappableYieldSource` at any time, immediately rugging all funds from old yield source**

**Report Description**:  
The `swapYieldSource` function in `SwappableYieldSource.sol` can be called by the owner or Asset Manager, allowing them to transfer all funds from the old yield source to a new one. If either the owner or Asset Manager has malicious intent, this function enables them to instantly rug all funds.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of unrestricted access to the `swapYieldSource` function or the potential for rugging funds. This is a critical oversight.

---

#### **[H-02] `redeemToken` can fail for certain tokens**

**Report Description**:  
The `redeemToken` function uses `ERC20.transferFrom` to transfer tokens back to the sender. However, some token implementations may fail because `transferFrom` checks if the contract approved itself for the `redeemableBalance`, even if the sender is the `from` address.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of `transferFrom` failing for certain token implementations. This is a significant vulnerability.

---

#### **[H-03] `setYieldSource` leads to temporary wrong results**

**Report Description**:  
The `setYieldSource` function changes the underlying yield source but does not immediately transfer the underlying balances, leaving the contract in a temporary inconsistent state. The `balanceOfToken` function will show incorrect results during this period.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of temporary inconsistency caused by `setYieldSource`. This is a critical oversight.

---

#### **[H-04] `SwappableYieldSource`: Missing same deposit token check in `transferFunds`**

**Report Description**:  
The `transferFunds` function transfers funds from a specified yield source to the current yield source but fails to check if the deposit tokens are the same. If the specified yield source's assets are of higher valuation, a malicious owner or Asset Manager could exploit this to pocket the difference.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of missing deposit token verification in `transferFunds`. This is a significant vulnerability.

---

#### **[M-01] Single-step process for critical ownership transfer/renounce is risky**

**Report Description**:  
The `SwappableYieldSource` contract inherits from `Ownable`, which allows for single-step ownership transfer and renouncing. This is risky because it is irrecoverable from any mistakes, and ownership plays a critical role in the protocol.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of single-step ownership transfer/renouncing. This is a significant oversight.

---

#### **[M-02] Use of `safeApprove` will always cause `approveMax` to revert**

**Report Description**:  
The `mStableYieldSource` contract uses OpenZeppelin’s `safeApprove`, which is deprecated and will revert if the current allowance is not zero. This prevents increasing the allowance unless it is completely reset to zero.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of `safeApprove` reverting in `mStableYieldSource`. This is a significant oversight.

---

#### **[M-03] Inconsistent balance when supplying transfer-on-fee or deflationary tokens**

**Report Description**:  
The `supplyTokenTo` function assumes that the full `amount` of `_depositToken` is transferred to itself after calling `safeTransferFrom`. However, if the token is transfer-on-fee or deflationary, the received amount may be less than the accounted amount, leading to inconsistencies.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of inconsistent balances with transfer-on-fee or deflationary tokens. This is a significant oversight.

---

#### **[M-04] Old yield source still has infinite approval**

**Report Description**:  
After swapping a yield source, the old yield source still has infinite approval. This could be exploited if the old yield source is not perfectly safe, as seen in previous attacks like Furucombo.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of infinite approval remaining for old yield sources. This is a significant oversight.
