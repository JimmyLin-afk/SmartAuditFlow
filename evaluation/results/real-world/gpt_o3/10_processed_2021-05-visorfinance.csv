}",5244,643,"[H-01] A previously timelocked NFT token becomes permanently stuck in vault if it’s ever moved back into the vault
Let’s consider a scenario where a particular NFT token was timelocked for a certain duration by the owner using `timeLockERC721()` with a delegate as the recipient and then transferred out of the vault by the delegate via transferERC721() but without unlocking it explicitly using `timeUnlockERC721()`. This is possible because `transferERC721()` does all the timelock checks on `expires/block.timestamp` and `recipient/msg.sender` as is done in timeUnlockERC721(). But it misses deleting timelockERC721s[key] for that NFT tokenID (as done in L572 of timeUnlockERC721()). Because of this missing deletion, if that same NFT is ever put back into the vault later but this time without a timelock, the vault logic still thinks it is a timelocked NFT with the older/stale recipient from earlier because of the missing deletion. So now the owner who makes the `transferERC721()` call will not match the older/stale recipient address and will fail the check on L510 (unless they control that stale recipient address from the earlier timelock).   [H-02] NFT transfer approvals are not removed and cannot be revoked thus leading to loss of NFT tokens
NFT transfer approvals that are set to true in `approveTransferERC721()` are never set to false and there is no way to remove such an nft approval. Impact 1: The approval is not removed (set to false) after a transfer in transferERC721(). So if the NFT is ever moved back into the owner's vault again, then the previous/compromised delegate can again transfer it to any address of choice without requiring a new approval.
Impact 2: If a delegate becomes compromised/untrustworthy after granting approval but before transfer then the owner will lose its NFT because there is no mechanism to revoke the approval that was granted earlier.
  [H-03] Approval for NFT transfers is not removed after transfer
The `Visor.transferERC721` does not reset the approval for the NFT.
An approved delegatee can move the NFT out of the contract once. It could be moved to a market and bought by someone else who then deposits it again to the same vault. The first delegatee can steal the NFT and move it out of the contract a second time.
  [H-04] Unbounded loop in _removeNft could lead to a griefing/DOS attack Griefing/DOS attack is possible when a malicious NFT contract sends many NFTs to the vault, which could cause excessive gas consumed and even transactions reverted when other users are trying to unlock or transfer NFTs.
The function `_removeNft` uses an unbounded loop, which iterates the array nfts until a specific one is found. If the NFT to be removed is at the very end of the nfts array, this function could consume a large amount of gas. The function onERC721Received is permission-less. The vault accepts any NFTs from any NFT contract and pushes the received NFT into the array nfts. A malicious user could write an NFT contract, which calls onERC721Received of the vault many times to make the array nfts grow to a large size. Besides, the malicious NFT contract reverts when anyone tries to transfer (e.g., safeTransferFrom) its NFT. The vault then has no way to remove the transferred NFT from the malicious NFT contract. The two only functions to remove NFTs, transferERC721 and timeUnlockERC721, fail since the malicious NFT contract reverts all safeTransferFrom calls. As a result, benign users who unlock or transfer NFTs would suffer from large and unnecessary gas consumption. The consumed gas could even exceed the block gas limit and cause the transaction to fail every time. Recommend using a mapping (e.g., mapping(address=>Nft[]) nfts) to store the received NFTs into separate arrays according to nftContract instead of putting them into the same one. Or, add a method specifically for the owner to remove NFTs from the nfts array directly.   [M-01] Unhandled return value of transferFrom in timeLockERC20() could lead to fund loss for recipients
ERC20 implementations are not always consistent. Some implementations of transfer and transferFrom could return ‘false’ on failure instead of reverting. It is safer to wrap such calls into require() statements or use safe wrapper functions implementing return value/data checks to handle these failures. For reference, see similar Medium-severity finding from Consensys Diligence Audit of Aave Protocol V2. While the contract uses Uniswap’s TransferHelper library function safeTransfer in other places for ERC20 tokens, or OpenZeppelin’s saferTransferFrom for ERC721 tokens (both of which call the token’s transfer/transferFrom functions and check return value for success and return data), it misses using TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom in this one case on L610 in timeLockERC20() when tokens are transferred from owner to the vault and instead directly uses the token’s transferFrom() call without checking for its return value.
The impact can be that for an arbitrary ERC20 token, this transferFrom() call may return failure but the vault logic misses that, assumes it was successfully transferred into the vault and updates the timelockERC20Balances accounting accordingly. The timeUnlockERC20(), transferERC20() or delegatedTransferERC20() calls for that token will fail because the vault contract balance would have less tokens than accounted for in timelockERC20Balances because of the previously failed (but ignored) transferFrom() call.
  [M-02] transferERC721 doesn't clean timelockERC721s
The function transferERC721 works similar to the functions timeUnlockERC721 with timelocked NFT's. However timeUnlockERC721 cleans timelockERC721s (delete timelockERC721s[key];), while transferERC721 doesn't clean timelockERC721s
This could mean that timelock keys could be used later on (when the NFT would have been transferred to the contract on a later moment in time). Also, the administration doesn't correspond to the available NFT's. Additionally doing a delete gives backs some gas (at least for now).   [M-03] `timelockERC721Keys` could exceed the block size limit
On line 504 of Visor.sol, looping through the `timelockERC721Keys` could exceed the block size limit

}",3800,4,3,"Examining potential issues
I’m digging into a smart contract in Solidity 0.7.6. It largely avoids integer overflow with SafeMath. Assert usage in critical functions raises security concerns, and gas inefficiencies might suggest areas for optimization.
Investigating security threats
Validating nonce updates post-signature check and the use of onlyValidSignature modifier to mitigate replay attacks. Examining delegatedTransferERC20 and transferERC721 for unauthorized transfers, and assessing the timelockERC20 implementation for safe transfer checks.
Assessing transfer protocols
I'm exploring potential vulnerabilities in ERC20 and ERC721 token transfers, specifically regarding unchecked return values and approval validations that could lead to unauthorized access or unexpected behavior.
Spotting potential miscalculations
OK, let me see. The getBalanceLocked function pulls the highest lock.balance, which could let more tokens be transferred than are actually locked, possibly leading to erroneous token transfers.
Evaluating balance checks
Hm, that's interesting. The getBalanceLocked function returns only the maximum lock balance, not the total sum, which might cause unauthorized transfers if multiple locks exist for the same token and delegate.
Spotting key derivation issues
I'm thinking about possible collision risks in deriving unique keys for approvals and transfers, particularly with flexible types like uint256 in timeLockERC20 and timeLockERC721.
Noticing nonce management
Confirming that the _nonce is incremented with each call, effectively managing parallel calls and validating signatures. This adds a layer of security and predictability.
Spotting verification gaps
OK, let's see: the timeUnlockERC20 function uses an amount parameter without checking the stored timelockERC20 amount. This might allow unlocking with mismatched values.
Spotting the issue
I'm thinking about how the timeUnlockERC20 function might face issues. A malicious user could exploit this by sending a lower amount to unlock funds, potentially leading to token loss.
Identifying gaps
Listing issues: getBalanceLocked inaccurately returns max instead of sum, and timeUnlockERC721 lacks tokenId verification, which can cause token loss or unauthorized transfers.
Identifying token drain
Hmm, I'm thinking about the risk of owners unintentionally draining tokens when conditions are precisely met, particularly in transferERC20 and delegatedTransferERC20 functions. This looks like a significant vulnerability.
Spotting confirmation errors
The timeLockERC721 function emits an incorrect event and fails to ensure no duplicate NFTs before locking them. Also, transferERC20 and delegatedTransferERC20 functions use a maximum value for locked tokens.
Spotting event mismatch
OK, let me see. The timeLockERC721 function might emit the wrong event due to onERC721Received triggering _addNft, but timeUnlockERC721 then needs to correctly remove the NFT from the array.
Investigating vulnerabilities
I'm digging into potential reentrancy issues in timeLockERC721 and transferERC20 functions. While external calls might pose risks, it's interesting to see progress in identifying these security threats.
Investigating reentrancy risks
Exploring timeUnlockERC721 for reentrancy vulnerabilities, I noticed it relies on _removeNft. If an NFT is double-locked, that might cause issues. Hm, that's worth thinking about.
Spotting reentrancy risks
I noticed that transferERC721 uses _removeNft and calls IERC721(nftContract).safeTransferFrom, which might trigger reentrancy. This raises some concerns about potential security issues.
Assessing reentrancy risks
TransferERC721 appears safe. TimeUnlockERC721 needs careful review for potential reentrancy due to its sequence of state updates and external calls, which might introduce security issues.
Clarifying reentrancy risks
OK, let's break this down: transferERC721 and timeUnlockERC20 appear safe. However, timeUnlockERC721 needs careful review due to its sequence of state updates and external calls triggered by onERC721Received.
Assessing vulnerabilities
It's interesting to see that transferERC721 and transferERC20 are secure. TimeUnlockERC721 needs attention due to its update and external call sequence, which might inadvertently trigger onERC721Received.
Risk assessment
OK, I'm mapping out the potential exploits: unauthorized owner changes, replay attacks due to nonce manipulation, and issues with insecure libraries or missing contract protections. Each of these risks demands careful attention.
Highlighting vulnerabilities
I’m examining a potential vulnerability in the initialization logic. Also, using assert for error handling lacks detail, and keccak256 encryption in timelockERC20 ensures key confidentiality and prevents unauthorized access to unlock tokens.
Confirming security measures
I'm mapping out the safety of getNftById and getNftIdByTokenIdAndAddr, noting no vulnerabilities. Examining TransferHelper safe transfers, low-level calls, and delegatedTransferERC20's conditional access.
Spotting potential risks
I’m noting that the lack of sender validation in delegatedTransferERC20 and the risk of DOS attacks due to unbounded loops in getBalanceLocked and transferERC721 are worth further exploration.
Analyzing potential issues
Examining timelockERC20Keys for indefinite growth and iterating over timelockERC721Keys in transferERC721, both of which could be exploited for DOS attacks.
Mitigating risks and ensuring safety
I'm working through signature verification and potential reentrancy issues in transferERC721, timeLockERC721, and timeUnlockERC721. Updates to state precede external calls to safeguard against reentrant attacks.
Identifying specific flaws
I'm focusing on the getBalanceLocked function's miscalculation and how this might allow unauthorized token draining via timeUnlockERC20, along with potential errors in delegatedTransferERC20 and transferERC20.
Highlighting specific vulnerabilities
I'm identifying risks in transferERC20, unbounded loops in dynamic arrays, lack of return value checks in timeLockERC20, and a typo in event emission in timeLockERC721. Friendspairs
Highlighting risks
I'm pinning down a parameter mismatch vulnerability in timeUnlockERC20, where the amount argument may not align with the stored timelock amount, and considering reentrancy risks from external token or NFT contract calls.
Assessing collision risk
I'm looking at the use of abi.encodePacked for generating unique keys, which could cause collisions with fixed-size parameters, and noting the absence of logic in the initializeLock function.
Assessing reentrancy risk
I’m working through the minimal reentrancy risk in transferERC20 due to its restricted usage of onlyOwner, safeTransfer after approval subtraction, and state changes preceding external calls.","Below is a non‐exhaustive list of issues found in the contract code. Note that some of these issues are “logic‐bugs” or design mistakes rather than “classic” security bugs, but they can nonetheless lead to unexpected behavior or be abused in certain contexts.

---

1. **Incorrect Locked‐Balance Calculation (“getBalanceLocked”):**  
   The function that is supposed to report the total locked ERC20 amount for a given token iterates over the lock set but only keeps the maximum lock balance rather than summing the balances from all locks. As a result, the “available balance” checks in functions like `transferERC20` and `delegatedTransferERC20` use an under‐calculated locked total. This may allow an attacker (or even the owner) to transfer out more tokens than intended because multiple locks are not aggregated.

2. **Unbounded Looping / Denial‐of‐Service (DoS) Risks:**  
   Several functions iterate over dynamic arrays or sets (for example, in `getBalanceLocked`, `checkBalances`, and in the loop inside `transferERC721` that iterates over `timelockERC721Keys[nftContract]`). If these arrays grow large (for example, by repeated locking operations or timelocks), callers may run out of gas when invoking these functions, effectively causing a DoS.

3. **Unchecked ERC20.transferFrom Return Value in timeLockERC20:**  
   In the `timeLockERC20` function the contract calls  
   ```solidity
   IERC20(token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
   ```  
   without checking that the call returned a truthy value. Some ERC20 tokens do not revert on failure but instead return false. In such cases, the contract might think tokens were transferred and record a timelock even though the tokens never left the sender’s account.

4. **Event Emission Typo for NFT Timelocks:**  
   The `timeLockERC721` function emits the event `TimeLockERC20` (with parameters matching an NFT timelock) instead of an event named for ERC721 timelocks. This “wrong‐event” bug is not a security risk by itself but can confuse off–chain watchers and auditors about the actual state changes.

5. **Lack of Verification of Amount in timeUnlockERC20:**  
   In `timeUnlockERC20` the function requires that the timelock has expired and that the caller is the designated recipient but never verifies that the `amount` parameter passed into the call matches the amount originally locked (which was stored in the timelock struct). This discrepancy could allow a caller to “unlock” an amount different from the locked amount. (Depending on the intended design this may be an oversight.)

6. **Use of assert Instead of Revert with a Message:**  
   Throughout the contract (for example when adding or removing elements from the `_lockSet`) the code uses `assert(...)`. In Solidity 0.7.x an assert failing consumes all remaining gas and does not provide a useful error message. Although an assert indicates a “should never happen” condition, if an attacker can force such a condition (or trigger an invariant failure via specially crafted inputs) it may cause unexpected reverts that are hard to diagnose.

7. **Empty “initializeLock” Function (Initialization Issues):**  
   The presence of an empty `initializeLock` function may indicate that some intended initialization logic is missing. If clients expect certain setup to occur there, this may lead to unexpected behavior.

8. **Potential (Minor) Concerns with Key Generation Using abi.encodePacked:**  
   The contract uses `abi.encodePacked` to form unique keys in several mappings (for NFT approvals, ERC20 approvals, timelock mappings, etc.). While in this code the types (addresses, uint256) are fixed‐sized and the risk of collisions is minimal, using `abi.encodePacked` (without a delimiter or without using `abi.encode`) can sometimes lead to collisions when concatenating dynamic or ambiguously sized types. (In this instance the risk is low, but it is something to be aware of.)","### **Comparison of Issue Report and Response List**

---

#### **[H-01] A previously timelocked NFT token becomes permanently stuck in vault if it’s ever moved back into the vault**

**Report Description**:  
If an NFT is timelocked using `timeLockERC721()` and later transferred out of the vault via `transferERC721()` without explicitly unlocking it, the `timelockERC721s[key]` entry for that NFT is not deleted. If the NFT is later moved back into the vault without a timelock, the vault logic still considers it timelocked with the stale recipient address. This causes the `transferERC721()` call to fail unless the caller controls the stale recipient address, effectively locking the NFT in the vault.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The problem of stale timelock entries and their impact on NFT transfers is not mentioned or analyzed in the response list.

---

#### **[H-02] NFT transfer approvals are not removed and cannot be revoked thus leading to loss of NFT tokens**

**Report Description**:  
NFT transfer approvals set in `approveTransferERC721()` are never reset or revoked. This allows a compromised delegate to transfer the NFT multiple times without requiring new approvals, even if the NFT is moved back into the owner's vault. Additionally, if a delegate becomes untrustworthy, the owner cannot revoke the approval, leading to potential loss of the NFT.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of NFT transfer approvals not being reset or revoked. This oversight is not covered in the response list.

---

#### **[H-03] Approval for NFT transfers is not removed after transfer**

**Report Description**:  
The `Visor.transferERC721` function does not reset the approval for the NFT after a transfer. This allows an approved delegatee to move the NFT out of the contract multiple times, even if the NFT is deposited back into the vault by a new owner.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of NFT transfer approvals not being reset after a transfer. This vulnerability is not covered in the response list.

---

#### **[H-04] Unbounded loop in `_removeNft` could lead to a griefing/DOS attack**

**Report Description**:  
The `_removeNft` function uses an unbounded loop to iterate through the `nfts` array, which could lead to excessive gas consumption or transaction reverts if the array grows too large. A malicious user could exploit this by sending many NFTs to the vault, causing the array to grow and making it difficult or impossible for other users to unlock or transfer their NFTs.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Unbounded Looping / Denial‐of‐Service (DoS) Risks""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue of unbounded loops leading to potential DoS risks. It correctly explains the risks associated with iterating over dynamic arrays, which aligns with the issue described in the report.

---

#### **[M-01] Unhandled return value of `transferFrom` in `timeLockERC20()` could lead to fund loss for recipients**

**Report Description**:  
The `timeLockERC20()` function does not check the return value of the `transferFrom` call. Some ERC20 tokens return `false` on failure instead of reverting. If the `transferFrom` call fails but the return value is not checked, the vault logic assumes the tokens were successfully transferred, leading to discrepancies in the `timelockERC20Balances` and potential fund loss for recipients.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Unchecked ERC20.transferFrom Return Value in timeLockERC20""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue of unchecked return values in the `timeLockERC20` function. It correctly explains the risks associated with not validating return values from external `transferFrom` calls, which aligns with the issue described in the report.

---

#### **[M-02] `transferERC721` doesn't clean `timelockERC721s`**

**Report Description**:  
The `transferERC721` function does not delete the `timelockERC721s[key]` entry for the NFT being transferred, unlike the `timeUnlockERC721` function. This could lead to stale timelock keys being used later, incorrect administration of available NFTs, and missed gas refunds from deletion.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of `timelockERC721s` not being cleaned in the `transferERC721` function. This oversight is not covered in the response list.

---

#### **[M-03] `timelockERC721Keys` could exceed the block size limit**

**Report Description**:  
The loop in `transferERC721` that iterates over `timelockERC721Keys` could exceed the block size limit if the array grows too large. This could cause transactions to fail due to excessive gas consumption.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Unbounded Looping / Denial‐of‐Service (DoS) Risks""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the issue of unbounded loops leading to potential DoS risks, but it does not specifically address the problem of `timelockERC721Keys` exceeding the block size limit. The response could have been more specific to this issue.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:

- **[H-04] Unbounded loop in `_removeNft` could lead to a griefing/DOS attack**
- **[M-01] Unhandled return value of `transferFrom` in `timeLockERC20()` could lead to fund loss for recipients**

**Partially Correct Matches**:
