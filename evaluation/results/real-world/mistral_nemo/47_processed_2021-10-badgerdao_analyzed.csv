}",1204.0,156.0,"[H-01] The design of `wibBTC` is not fully compatible with the current Curve StableSwap pool
Per the documentation, variables `wibBTC` is designed for a Curve StableSwap pool. However, the design of `wibBTC` makes the balances change dynamically and automatically. This is unusual for an ERC20 token, and it's not fully compatible with the current Curve StableSwap pool.
Specifically, a Curve StableSwap pool will maintain the balances of its `coins` based on the amount of tokens added, removed, and exchanged each time. In another word, it can not adopt the dynamic changes of the balances that happened automatically.
The pool's actual dynamic balance of `wibBTC` will deviate from the recorded balance in the pool contract as the pricePerShare increases.

[H-02] Approved spender can spend too many tokens
The `approve` function has not been overridden and therefore uses the internal shares, whereas transfer(From) uses the rebalanced amount.
Impact: The approved spender may spend more tokens than desired. In fact, the approved amount that can be transferred keeps growing with `pricePerShare`.
Many contracts also use the same amount for the `approve` call as for the amount they want to have transferred in a subsequent `transferFrom` call, and in this case, they approve an amount that is too large (as the approved `shares` amount yields a higher rebalanced amount).

[H-04] `WrappedIbbtc` contracts do not filter out price feed outliers
If price feed is manipulated in any way or there is any malfunction based volatility on the market, both contracts will pass it on a user. In the same time it's possible to construct mitigation mechanics for such cases, so user economics would be affected by sustainable price movements only. As price outrages provide a substantial attack surface for the project it's worth adding some complexity to the implementation.

[M-01] Unable to transfer WrappedIbbtc if Oracle go down
In function `WrappedIbbtc`, user will not be able to transfer if `oracle.pricePerShare()` (L124) revert. This is because balanceToShares() is called in both transfer and transferFrom, which included a call to pricePerShare().
If this is the expected behavior, note that WrappedIbbtcEth is behaving the opposite as it uses the cached value in a local variable pricePerShare, which is only updated upon call to updatePricePerShare().

[M-02] Null check in `pricePerShare`
oracle can 0 as a price of the share, in that case, 0 will be the denominator in some calculations which can cause reverts from SafeMath (for e.g here: WrappedIbbtc.sol L148) resulting in Denial Of Service.

[M-03] hard to clear balance
The contract does not allow users to `transfer` by share. Therefore, It is hard for users to clear out all the shares. There will be users using this token with Metamask and it is likely the `pricePerShare` would increase after the user sends transactions. I consider this is a medium-risk issue.

[M-04] No sanity check on `pricePerShare` might lead to lost value
`pricePerShare` is read either from an oracle or from ibBTC's core.
If one of these is bugged or exploited, there are no safety checks to prevent loss of funds.Impact: As pricePerShare is used to calculate transfer amount, a bug or wrong data retuning a smaller pricePerShare than it really is, could result in drainage of wibbtc from Curve pool.",7.0,"pragma solidity ^0.6.12;

}",811.0,3,4,"Identified vulnerabilities:
1. **Oracle Manipulation** *(High)*:  
   **Description:**  
   The contract relies on an external oracle (`ICoreOracle`) to fetch the `pricePerShare`. If the oracle is compromised or manipulated, it can return incorrect prices, leading to incorrect calculations of balances, shares, and total supply. This can result in users losing funds or receiving incorrect amounts of tokens.
   
   **Impact:**  
   Users can lose funds or receive incorrect amounts of tokens due to manipulated prices. The contract's financial integrity is compromised.

   **Mitigation:**  
   ```solidity
   // Implement multiple oracle sources and use a median or consensus-based value.
   // Consider using a decentralized oracle solution like Chainlink.
   ```

2. **Lack of Oracle Failover or Fallback Mechanism** *(Medium)*:  
   **Description:**  
   The contract does not handle the case where the oracle fails to return a value or returns an invalid value. If the `pricePerShare()` function call fails, the contract will revert, potentially locking funds or causing other issues.
   
   **Impact:**  
   If the oracle fails, the contract will revert, potentially locking funds or causing other issues. This can disrupt the contract's functionality.

   **Mitigation:**  
   ```solidity
   // Add a fallback mechanism to handle oracle failure.
   // For example, use a default value or revert with a meaningful error message.
   function pricePerShare() public view virtual returns (uint256) {
       uint256 price = oracle.pricePerShare();
       require(price > 0, ""Oracle failed to return a price"");
       return price;
   }
   ```

3. **Reentrancy Risk** *(Medium)*:  
   **Description:**  
   The `transferFrom` and `transfer` functions involve external calls to the ERC20 token (`ibbtc.transferFrom` and `ibbtc.transfer`). If the ERC20 token contract is malicious or has a fallback function that reenters the contract, it could lead to unexpected behavior or exploits.
   
   **Impact:**  
   A malicious ERC20 token contract could reenter the contract and manipulate its state, potentially draining funds or causing other issues.

   **Mitigation:**  
   ```solidity
   // Use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern and consider using OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard.
   // For example:
   function transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) public virtual override returns (bool) {
       uint256 amountInShares = balanceToShares(amount);
       _transfer(sender, recipient, amountInShares);
       _approve(sender, _msgSender(), _allowances[sender][_msgSender()].sub(amountInShares, ""ERC20: transfer amount exceeds allowance""));
       return true;
   }
   ```

4. **Unchecked Return Values** *(Low)*:  
   **Description:**  
   The contract does not check the return values of ERC20 transfer functions, which could lead to silent failures if the transfers fail.
   
   **Impact:**  
   If the ERC20 transfer functions fail silently, users may lose funds or experience unexpected behavior.

   **Mitigation:**  
   ```solidity
   // Check the return values of ERC20 transfer functions.
   require(ibbtc.transfer(_msgSender(), _shares), ""ERC20 transfer failed"");
   ```

5. **Centralization Risk** *(Medium)*:  
   **Description:**  
   The contract relies on a single governance address to manage critical functions such as setting the pending governance and oracle. If this address is compromised, an attacker could take control of the contract.
   
   **Impact:**  
   If the governance address is compromised, an attacker could set the pending governance to their own address, allowing them to take control of the contract.

   **Mitigation:**  
   ```solidity
   // Use a multi-signature wallet or a decentralized governance mechanism.
   // For example:
   function setPendingGovernance(address _pendingGovernance) external onlyGovernance {
       require(_pendingGovernance!= address(0), ""Invalid address"");
       pendingGovernance = _pendingGovernance;
       emit SetPendingGovernance(pendingGovernance);
   }

---

**[H-01] The design of `wibBTC` is not fully compatible with the current Curve StableSwap pool**

**Report Description**:  
The `wibBTC` token is designed for a Curve StableSwap pool, but its dynamic and automatic balance changes are unusual for an ERC20 token and incompatible with the Curve pool. The Curve pool maintains balances based on token additions, removals, and exchanges, and cannot handle automatic balance changes. This discrepancy causes the actual dynamic balance of `wibBTC` to deviate from the recorded balance in the pool contract as `pricePerShare` increases.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the incompatibility between `wibBTC`'s dynamic balance changes and the Curve StableSwap pool. This issue is specific to the token design and its interaction with the Curve pool, which is not covered in the response list.

---

**[H-02] Approved spender can spend too many tokens**

**Report Description**:  
The `approve` function uses internal `shares`, while `transfer(From)` uses the rebalanced amount. This discrepancy allows an approved spender to spend more tokens than intended, as the approved amount grows with `pricePerShare`. Many contracts approve the same amount for `transferFrom`, leading to over-approval.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of over-approval due to the mismatch between `shares` and rebalanced amounts in the `approve` and `transfer(From)` functions.

---

**[H-04] `WrappedIbbtc` contracts do not filter out price feed outliers**

**Report Description**:  
The contracts do not filter out price feed outliers, which can be manipulated or result from market volatility. This exposes users to economic risks and provides an attack surface. Mitigation mechanics could limit the impact to sustainable price movements.

**Match in Response List**:  
**Oracle Manipulation** *(High)*.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the risk of oracle manipulation but does not address the specific issue of filtering out price feed outliers or constructing mitigation mechanics.

---

**[M-01] Unable to transfer `WrappedIbbtc` if Oracle goes down**

**Report Description**:  
If `oracle.pricePerShare()` reverts, users cannot transfer `WrappedIbbtc` because `balanceToShares()` calls `pricePerShare()` in both `transfer` and `transferFrom`. This contrasts with `WrappedIbbtcEth`, which uses a cached value updated only upon calling `updatePricePerShare()`.

**Match in Response List**:  
**Lack of Oracle Failover or Fallback Mechanism** *(Medium)*.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue of oracle failure and suggests adding a fallback mechanism, which aligns with the reported problem.

---

**[M-02] Null check in `pricePerShare`**

**Report Description**:  
If `pricePerShare` returns `0`, it becomes the denominator in calculations, causing reverts from SafeMath and resulting in Denial of Service.

**Match in Response List**:  
**Lack of Oracle Failover or Fallback Mechanism** *(Medium)*.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response addresses oracle failure but does not specifically mention the risk of `0` as a denominator or the resulting Denial of Service.

---

**[M-03] Hard to clear balance**

**Report Description**:  
The contract does not allow users to `transfer` by share, making it difficult to clear out all shares. As `pricePerShare` increases, users may face challenges when using tools like Metamask.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of transferring by share or the difficulty in clearing balances.

---

**[M-04] No sanity check on `pricePerShare` might lead to lost value**

**Report Description**:  
If `pricePerShare` is bugged or exploited, there are no safety checks to prevent loss of funds. A smaller `pricePerShare` than the actual value could result in drainage of `wibbtc` from the Curve pool.

**Match in Response List**:  
**Oracle Manipulation** *(High)*.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the risk of oracle manipulation but does not specifically address the lack of sanity checks on `pricePerShare` or the potential drainage of `wibbtc`.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:

- **[M-01] Unable to transfer `WrappedIbbtc` if Oracle goes down**

**Partially Correct Matches**:

- **[H-04] `WrappedIbbtc` contracts do not filter out price feed outliers**
- **[M-02] Null check in `pricePerShare`**
- **[M-04] No sanity check on `pricePerShare` might lead to lost value**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:

- **[H-01] The design of `wibBTC` is not fully compatible with the current Curve StableSwap pool**
- **[H-02] Approved spender can spend too many tokens**
- **[M-03] Hard to clear balance**

--- 

### **Conclusion**

The response list covers some issues, particularly those related to oracle manipulation and failure. However, it misses critical issues such as the incompatibility of `wibBTC` with the Curve pool, over-approval in the `approve` function, and the difficulty in clearing balances. Additionally, some responses are partially correct, as they identify the broader issue but miss specific details or impacts.",1,4,2,16,"```
1. Lack of Oracle Failover or Fallback Mechanism
```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the rank of the true positive**:
   - The true positive is ""Lack of Oracle Failover or Fallback Mechanism"".
   - It appears at rank 2 in the ranked list of predictions.

2. **Calculate the precision at that rank**:
   - Precision at rank 2 (\( P@2 \)) is the number of true positives up to rank 2 divided by 2.
   - Since there is only one true positive up to rank 2, \( P@2 = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

3. **Compute the Average Precision (AP)**:
   - Since there is only one true positive, the AP is simply the precision at its rank.
   - Therefore, \( AP = 0.5 \).

**Output**:
```
0.5

}",854.0,2,0,"Identified vulnerabilities:
1. **Price Manipulation** *(High)*:  
   **Description:**  
   The `updatePricePerShare` function relies on the `pricePerShare` function of the `ICore` contract. If the `ICore` contract is compromised or malicious, it can manipulate the `pricePerShare` value, leading to incorrect token pricing and potential loss of funds for users. There's no validation of the returned price, and no mechanism to revert or correct the price if it's manipulated.
   
   **Impact:**  
   An attacker could manipulate the `pricePerShare` value to either inflate or deflate the value of the wrapped tokens, causing users to lose funds or gain an unfair advantage.

   **Mitigation:**  
   ```solidity
   // Add validation for the pricePerShare returned by the core contract
   function updatePricePerShare() public virtual returns (uint256) {
       uint256 newPricePerShare = core.pricePerShare();
       require(newPricePerShare > 0, ""Invalid price per share"");
       require(newPricePerShare == pricePerShare || lastPricePerShareUpdate + 1 days <= now, ""Price update too frequent""); // Prevents rapid price changes
       pricePerShare = newPricePerShare;
       lastPricePerShareUpdate = now;

       emit SetPricePerShare(pricePerShare, lastPricePerShareUpdate);
   }
   ```

2. **Lack of Access Control on `updatePricePerShare`** *(Medium)*:  
   **Description:**  
   The `updatePricePerShare` function is public and can be called by anyone. While it relies on the `ICore` contract, there's no mechanism to prevent unauthorized calls to this function, which could potentially trigger unnecessary price updates or disrupt the contract's state.
   
   **Impact:**  
   Malicious actors could call `updatePricePerShare` to trigger price updates at inopportune times, potentially disrupting the contract's operations or causing users to lose funds due to incorrect pricing.

   **Mitigation:**  
   ```solidity
   // Add access control to restrict who can call updatePricePerShare
   modifier onlyGovernanceOrCore() {
       require(msg.sender == governance || msg.sender == address(core), ""onlyGovernanceOrCore"");
       _;
   }

   function updatePricePerShare() public virtual onlyGovernanceOrCore returns (uint256) {
       uint256 newPricePerShare = core.pricePerShare();
       require(newPricePerShare > 0, ""Invalid price per share"");
       require(newPricePerShare == pricePerShare || lastPricePerShareUpdate + 1 days <= now, ""Price update too frequent""); // Prevents rapid price changes
       pricePerShare = newPricePerShare;
       lastPricePerShareUpdate = now;

       emit SetPricePerShare(pricePerShare, lastPricePerShareUpdate);
   }
   ```<|eot_id|>","### **[H-03] WrappedIbbtcEth contract will use stalled price for mint/burn if `updatePricePerShare` wasn't run properly**

**Report Description**:  
The `WrappedIbbtcEth` contract relies on the `pricePerShare` value for minting and burning tokens. If the `updatePricePerShare` function is not called frequently enough, the `pricePerShare` value may become outdated. A malicious user can monitor the `SetPricePerShare` event and, if the price is outdated, mint tokens at the outdated price, wait for a price update, and then burn tokens at the updated price, yielding a risk-free profit at the expense of the contract's holdings.

**Match in Response List**:  
No direct match found. The response list discusses **Price Manipulation** and **Lack of Access Control on `updatePricePerShare`**, but it does not address the specific issue of using a stalled price for minting and burning tokens.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the core issue of using a stalled `pricePerShare` value for minting and burning tokens. While it discusses price manipulation and access control, it misses the critical vulnerability of outdated pricing leading to arbitrage opportunities.

### **[H-04] WrappedIbbtcEth contracts do not filter out price feed outliers**

**Report Description**:  
The `WrappedIbbtcEth` contract does not filter out price feed outliers, which could result from market manipulation or malfunctioning price feeds. This exposes users to unsustainable price movements and provides a substantial attack surface. The contract could implement mitigation mechanics to ensure that only sustainable price movements affect user economics.

**Match in Response List**:  
Partially matches with the issue titled **Price Manipulation**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response list identifies the risk of price manipulation and the lack of validation for the `pricePerShare` value. However, it does not specifically address the issue of filtering out price feed outliers or implementing mitigation mechanics to handle unsustainable price movements. The response focuses on preventing rapid price changes but does not cover the broader issue of outlier filtering.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:  
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:  
- **[H-04] WrappedIbbtcEth contracts do not filter out price feed outliers**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:  
- **[H-03] WrappedIbbtcEth contract will use stalled price for mint/burn if `updatePricePerShare` wasn't run properly**

---

### **Conclusion**  
The response list partially addresses one of the issues but misses the critical vulnerability of using a stalled `pricePerShare` value for minting and burning tokens. Additionally, while it touches on price manipulation, it does not fully cover the need for filtering out price feed outliers. Improvements are needed to ensure comprehensive coverage of the identified vulnerabilities.",0,1,1,14,"```
