}",3357,388,"[H-01] Can force borrower to pay huge interest
In the function `lend()`, the loan amount is used as a min loan amount. It can be matched as high as possible (realistically up to the collateral NFT's worth to remain in profit) and the borrower has to pay interest on the entire amount instead of just on the desired loan amount when the loan was created.

[H-02] currentLoanOwner can manipulate loanInfo when any lenders try to buyout
If an attacker already calls `lend()` to lend to a loan, the attacker can manipulate `loanInfo` by reentrancy attack when any lenders try to buyout. The attacker can set bad values of lendInfo (e.g. very long duration, and 0 interest rate) that the lender who wants to buyout don't expect.

[H-03] Borrower can be their own lender and steal funds from buyout due to reentrancy
If borrower lends their own loan, they can repay and close the loan before ownership of the lend ticket is transferred to the new lender. The borrower will keep the NFT + loan amount + accrued interest.[M-01] When an attacker lends to a loan, the attacker can trigger DoS that any lenders can not buyout it

[M-02] Protocol doesn't handle fee on transfer tokens
Since the borrower is able to specify any asset token, it is possible that loans will be created with tokens that support fee on transfer. If a fee on transfer asset token is chosen, the protocol will contain a point of failure on the original `lend()` call.

[M-03] sendCollateralTo is unchecked in closeLoan(), which can cause user's collateral NFT to be frozen
The `sendCollateralTo` will receive the collateral NFT when `closeLoan()` is called. However, if `sendCollateralTo` is a contract address that does not support ERC721, the collateral NFT can be frozen in the contract.

[M-04] `requiredImprovementRate` can not work as expected when `previousInterestRate` less than 10 due to precision loss

[M-05] Borrowers lose funds if they call `repayAndCloseLoan` instead of `closeLoan`
The `repayAndCloseLoan` function does not revert if there has not been a lender for a loan (matched with `lend`). Users should use closeLoan in this case but the contract should disallow calling `repayAndCloseLoan` because users can lose funds.
It performs a `ERC20(loan.loanAssetContractAddress).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, lender, interest + loan.loanAmount)` call where interest will be a high value accumulated from timestamp 0 and the loan.loanAmount is the initially desired min loan amount `minLoanAmount` set in `createLoan`. The user will lose these funds if they ever approved the contract (for example, for another loan).

[M-06] Might not get desired min loan amount if _originationFeeRate changes
Admins can update the origination fee by calling `updateOriginationFeeRate`. Note that a borrower does not receive their `minLoanAmount` set in createLoan, they only receive `(1 - originationFee) * minLoanAmount`, see lend. Therefore, they need to precalculate the `minLoanAmount` using the `current` origination fee to arrive at the post-fee amount that they actually receive. If admins then increase the fee, the borrower receives fewer funds than required to cover their rent and might become homeless.

[M-07] `mintBorrowTicketTo` can be a contract with no `onERC721Received` method, which may cause the `BorrowTicket NFT` to be frozen and put users' funds at risk

}",2789,3,7,"Identified vulnerabilities:
1. **Integer Overflow/Underflow in Interest Calculation** *(CRITICAL)*:  
   **Description:**  
   The calculation of `interestOwed` in the `_interestOwed` function is vulnerable to integer overflow/underflow.  The product `(block.timestamp - lastAccumulatedTimestamp) * (perAnumInterestRate * 1e18 / 365 days)` can overflow before being added to `accumulatedInterest`.  If `block.timestamp - lastAccumulatedTimestamp` is very large, the product can overflow, leading to a very small result that is less than the actual interest owed.  If `block.timestamp - lastAccumulatedTimestamp` is very small, the product can underflow, leading to a very large result that is greater than the actual interest owed.
   
   **Impact:**  
   Users may be charged incorrect interest, either less than they should pay or more than they should pay, leading to financial loss.  A large underflow could potentially cause the interest to wrap around to a very small value, leading to a denial of service.

   **Mitigation:**  
   ```solidity
   // Use SafeMath library or Solidity 0.8.0+ which has built-in overflow checks
   // Or use a checked multiplication:
   uint256 interest = loanAmount * (block.timestamp - lastAccumulatedTimestamp);
   require(interest >= loanAmount, ""Interest overflow"");
   interest = interest * (perAnumInterestRate * 1e18 / 365 days) / 1e21;
   require(interest >= 0, ""Interest underflow"");
   return interest + accumulatedInterest;
   ```

2. **Denial of Service via Blocked Transfers** *(HIGH)*:  
   **Description:**  
   The contract uses `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom` from `SafeTransferLib` to transfer ERC20 tokens. These functions check for success and revert if the transfer fails. However, if the recipient is a contract that rejects the transfer (e.g., by not implementing a `receive` or `fallback` function, or by intentionally rejecting the transfer), the entire transaction will revert.  The `withdrawOriginationFees` function is particularly vulnerable to this, as it attempts to transfer the entire withdrawal amount in a single transaction.  If the transfer fails, the entire withdrawal fails, even if a partial withdrawal would be acceptable.
   
   **Impact:**  
   A malicious contract could be registered as a recipient and block the entire `withdrawOriginationFees` function, preventing the owner from withdrawing fees.  This could be used to disrupt the contract's functionality.

   **Mitigation:**  
   ```solidity
   // Implement a pull payment pattern where the recipient withdraws their funds
   // or use a more robust transfer method like `call` with error handling:
   ERC20 token = ERC20(asset);
   (bool success, ) = to.call{value: amount}("""");
   require(success, ""Transfer failed"");

### **Detailed Analysis**

---

**[H-01] Can force borrower to pay huge interest**

**Report Description**:
In the function `lend()`, the loan amount is used as a min loan amount. It can be matched as high as possible (realistically up to the collateral NFT's worth to remain in profit) and the borrower has to pay interest on the entire amount instead of just on the desired loan amount when the loan was created.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue at all. The issue involves the manipulation of loan amounts and interest calculations, which is not covered in the provided responses.

---

**[H-02] currentLoanOwner can manipulate loanInfo when any lenders try to buyout**

**Report Description**:
If an attacker already calls `lend()` to lend to a loan, the attacker can manipulate `loanInfo` by reentrancy attack when any lenders try to buyout. The attacker can set bad values of `lendInfo` (e.g., very long duration, and 0 interest rate) that the lender who wants to buyout don't expect.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address reentrancy attacks or the manipulation of `loanInfo` during buyout attempts.

---

**[H-03] Borrower can be their own lender and steal funds from buyout due to reentrancy**

**Report Description**:
If borrower lends their own loan, they can repay and close the loan before ownership of the lend ticket is transferred to the new lender. The borrower will keep the NFT + loan amount + accrued interest.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this reentrancy issue or the potential for borrowers to act as their own lenders to steal funds.

---

**[M-01] When an attacker lends to a loan, the attacker can trigger DoS that any lenders can not buyout it**

**Report Description**:
When an attacker lends to a loan, they can trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) that prevents any lenders from buying out the loan.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this DoS issue or the potential for attackers to block buyout attempts.

---

**[M-02] Protocol doesn't handle fee on transfer tokens**

**Report Description**:
Since the borrower is able to specify any asset token, it is possible that loans will be created with tokens that support fee on transfer. If a fee on transfer asset token is chosen, the protocol will contain a point of failure on the original `lend()` call.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the handling of fee-on-transfer tokens or the potential for failures in the `lend()` function.

---

**[M-03] `sendCollateralTo` is unchecked in `closeLoan()`, which can cause user's collateral NFT to be frozen**

**Report Description**:
The `sendCollateralTo` will receive the collateral NFT when `closeLoan()` is called. However, if `sendCollateralTo` is a contract address that does not support ERC721, the collateral NFT can be frozen in the contract.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of unchecked `sendCollateralTo` addresses or the potential for NFTs to be frozen.

---

**[M-04] `requiredImprovementRate` can not work as expected when `previousInterestRate` less than 10 due to precision loss**

**Report Description**:
The `requiredImprovementRate` may not work as expected when `previousInterestRate` is less than 10 due to precision loss in calculations.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address precision loss issues or the functionality of `requiredImprovementRate`.

---

**[M-05] Borrowers lose funds if they call `repayAndCloseLoan` instead of `closeLoan`**

**Report Description**:
The `repayAndCloseLoan` function does not revert if there has not been a lender for a loan (matched with `lend`). Users should use `closeLoan` in this case but the contract should disallow calling `repayAndCloseLoan` because users can lose funds. It performs a `ERC20(loan.loanAssetContractAddress).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, lender, interest + loan.loanAmount)` call where `interest` will be a high value accumulated from timestamp 0 and the `loan.loanAmount` is the initially desired min loan amount `minLoanAmount` set in `createLoan`. The user will lose these funds if they ever approved the contract (for example, for another loan).

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of users losing funds due to incorrect function calls or the handling of `repayAndCloseLoan`.

---

**[M-06] Might not get desired min loan amount if `_originationFeeRate` changes**

**Report Description**:
Admins can update the origination fee by calling `updateOriginationFeeRate`. Note that a borrower does not receive their `minLoanAmount` set in `createLoan`, they only receive `(1 - originationFee) * minLoanAmount`, see `lend`. Therefore, they need to precalculate the `minLoanAmount` using the `current` origination fee to arrive at the post-fee amount that they actually receive. If admins then increase the fee, the borrower receives fewer funds than required to cover their rent and might become homeless.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of borrowers receiving fewer funds due to changes in `_originationFeeRate`.

---

**[M-07] `mintBorrowTicketTo` can be a contract with no `onERC721Received` method, which may cause the `BorrowTicket NFT` to be frozen and put users' funds at risk**

**Report Description**:
“IERC721Mintable(borrowTicketContract).mint(mintBorrowTicketTo, id);”

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of `BorrowTicket` NFTs being frozen due to contracts not implementing `onERC721Received`.

---
