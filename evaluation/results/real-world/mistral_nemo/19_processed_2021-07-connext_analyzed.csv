// Outstanding qs:
// - what happens if you have unique user data, but duplicate tx ids?
//   no requires here would catch this, the tx would be properly prepared
//
// - we validate all the inputs but the amount, bidSignature, and encodedBid.
//   bidSignature and encodedBid could be used as slashing later, and their
//   validation is out of scope of this function. But, do we want to be able
//   to use this to send 0-value amounts? basically as some incentivized
//   relayer? would that break bidding?


/// @title TransactionManager
/// @author Connext <support@connext.network>
/// @notice This contract holds the logic to facilitate crosschain transactions.
///         Transactions go through three phases:
///
///         1. Route Auction: User broadcasts to our network signalling their 
///         desired route. Routers respond with sealed bids containing 
///         commitments to fulfilling the transaction within a certain time and 
///         price range.
///
///         2. Prepare: Once the auction is completed, the transaction can be 
///         prepared. The user submits a transaction to `TransactionManager` 
///         contract on sender-side chain containing router's signed bid. This 
///         transaction locks up the users funds on the sending chiain. Upon 
///         detecting an event containing their signed bid from the chain, 
///         router submits the same transaction to `TransactionManager` on the 
///         receiver-side chain, and locks up a corresponding amount of 
///         liquidity. The amount locked on the receiving chain is `sending 
///         amount - auction fee` so the router is incentivized to complete the 
///         transaction.
///
///         3. Fulfill: Upon detecting the `TransactionPrepared` event on the 
///         receiver-side chain, the user signs a message and sends it to a 
///         relayer, who will earn a fee for submission. The relayer (which may 
///         be the router) then submits the message to the `TransactionManager` 
///         to complete their transaction on receiver-side chain and claim the 
///         funds locked by the router. A relayer is used here to allow users 
///         to submit transactions with arbitrary calldata on the receiving 
///         chain without needing gas to do so. The router then submits the 
///         same signed message and completes transaction on sender-side, 
///         unlocking the original `amount`.
///
///         If a transaction is not fulfilled within a fixed timeout, it 
///         reverts and can be reclaimed by the party that called `prepare` on 
///         each chain (initiator). Additionally, transactions can be cancelled 
///         unilaterally by the person owed funds on that chain (router for 
///         sending chain, user for receiving chain) prior to expiry.

}",6657,654,"[H-01] Anyone can arbitrarily add router liquidity
The `addLiquidity()` function takes a router address parameter, whose liquidity is increased (instead of assuming that `router` == `msg.sender` like is done on `removeLiquidity()`) on this contract/chain, by transferring the fund amount from router address to this contract if `assetID` != 0 (i.e. ERC20 tokens). However, anyone can call this function on the router’s behalf. For assetID == 0, the Ether transfer via msg.value comes from msg.sender and hence is assumed to be the router itself.
The impact is that this will allow anyone to call this function and arbitrarily move ERC20 tokens from router address to this contract, assuming router has given max approval to this contract and has assetID amount available for transfer. While the router can always remove the liquidity if it doesn’t want to maintain that level of liquidity, this lack of access control or flexibility for a relayer to add liquidity on router’s behalf, may unnecessarily (and without authorization) increase the router’s exposure to protocol risk to more than it desires. See TransactionManager.sol #L88-L98. See also, use of msg.sender in removeLiquidity (#L88-L98).
  [H-02] `activeTransactionBlocks` are vulnerable to DDoS attacks
There is a potential issue in function `removeUserActiveBlocks` and the for loop inside it. I assume you are aware of block gas limits (they may be less relevant on other chains but still needs to be accounted for), so as there is no limit for `activeTransactionBlocks`, it may grow so large that the for loop may never finish. You should consider introducing an upper limit for `activeTransactionBlocks`. Also, a malicious actor may block any account (DDOS) by just calling `prepare` again and again with 0 amount acting as a router. This will push `activeTransactionBlocks` to the specified user until it is no longer possible to remove them from the array.
This is also a gas issue, as function `removeUserActiveBlocks` iterating and assigning large dynamic arrays is very gas-consuming. Consider optimizing the algorithm, e.g. finding the first occurrence, then swap it with the last item, pop the array, and break. Or maybe even using an EnumerableMap, so you can find and remove elements in O(1).
The best solution depends on what the usual number of `activeTransactionBlocks` is. If it is expected to be low (e.g. less than 5), then the current approach will work. But with larger arrays, I expect EnumerableMap would be more efficient.
Because an upper limit will not fully mitigate this issue, as a malicious actor can still DDOS the user by pushing useless txs until this limit is reached and a valid router may not be able to submit new txs. And, because you need to improve both the security and performance of removeUserActiveBlocks; EnumerableMap may be a go-to solution.
  [H-03] Router liquidity on receiving chain can be double-dipped by the user
During `fulfill()` on the receiving chain, if the user has set up an external contract at `txData.callTo`, the catch blocks for both `IFulfillHelper.addFunds()` and `IFulfillHelper.excute()` perform `transferAsset` to the predetermined fallback address `txData.receivingAddress`.
If `addFunds()` has reverted earlier, `toSend` amount would already have been transferred to the `receivingAddress`. If `execute()` also fails, it is again transferred.
  [H-04] Expired transfers will lock user funds on the sending chain function `cancel()`
The cancelling relayer is being paid in `receivingAssetId` on the sendingChain instead of in sendingAssetID. If the user relies on a relayer to cancel transactions, and that receivingAssetId asset does not exist on the sending chain (assuming only sendingAssetID on the sending chain and receivingAssetId on the receiving chain are assured to be valid and present), then the cancel transaction from the relayer will always revert and user’s funds will remain locked on the sending chain.
The impact is that expired transfers can never be cancelled and user funds will be locked forever if user relies on a relayer.
  [H-05] Approval is not reset if the call to IFulfillHelper fails
The function `fulfill` first approves the `callTo` to transfer an amount of toSend tokens and tries to call IFulfillHelper, but if the call fails, it transfers these assets directly. However, in such case the approval is not reset, so a malicous callTo can pull these tokens later:   [M-01] Signatures use only tx ID instead of entire digest
The signature check in `recoverFulfillSignature()` only uses transaction ID (along with the relayer fee) which can be accidentally reused by the user, in which case the older signatures with the older relayer fees can be replayed. The signature should be on the entire digest hashInvariantTransactionData(txData) as indicated in the comment on L306.
The impact is that, If the user signatures are indeed on the digest as indicated by the comment, the signature/address check in fulfill() will fail. If not, they may be accidentally/intentionally replayed with same transaction ID, which also appears to be an outstanding question as indicated by the comment on L12.
  [M-02] Malicious router can block cross-chain-transfers
The agreement between the `user` and the `router` seems to already happen off-chain because all the fields are required for the initial In `variantTransactionData call already. A router could pretend to take on a user's cross-chain transfer, the user sends their prepare transaction, locking up funds on the sending chain. But then the router simply doesn't respond or responds with a prepare transaction of amount=0.
The user's funds are then locked for the entire expiry time, whereas the router does not have to lock up anything as the amount is 0, even no gas if they simply don't respond. In this way, a router can bid on everything off-chain without a penalty, and take down everyone that accepts the bid.",7,"pragma solidity 0.8.4;

}",3101,5,2,"Identified vulnerabilities:
1. **Signature Replay Attack** *(High)*:  
   **Description:**  
   The contract uses ECDSA signatures for fulfilling and canceling transactions. However, there is no mechanism to prevent replay attacks. The same signature can be reused on different chains or contexts, leading to unauthorized actions.

   **Impact:**  
   An attacker could reuse a valid signature to fulfill or cancel transactions multiple times, potentially draining funds or canceling valid transactions.

   **Mitigation:**  
   ```solidity
   // Implement a nonce or chain-specific identifier in the message hash.
   // Example:
   // bytes32 digest = keccak256(abi.encode(SignedFulfillData({
   //   transactionId: txData.transactionId,
   //   relayerFee: relayerFee,
   //   nonce: txData.userNonce // Add nonce
   // }))));
   ```

2. **Lack of Access Control** *(Medium)*:  
   **Description:**  
   The contract does not implement robust access control mechanisms. For example, the `cancel` function can be called by anyone, and the `fulfill` function relies on a signature from the user but does not validate the signature's context.

   **Impact:**  
   Unauthorized users could call `cancel` on transactions they do not own, potentially disrupting legitimate transactions. The `fulfill` function could be exploited by malicious users if the signature context is not properly validated.

   **Mitigation:**  
   ```solidity
   // Add access control modifiers like onlyOwner or require(msg.sender == user).
   // Example:
   // modifier onlyUser(address user) {
   //   require(msg.sender == user, ""Not authorized"");
   //   _;
   // }
   // function cancel(TransactionData calldata txData, uint256 relayerFee, bytes calldata signature) external override nonReentrant onlyUser(txData.user) {... }
   ```

3. **Gas Limit Issues** *(Medium)*:  
   **Description:**  
   The contract does not account for gas limits in its transaction logic. If a transaction involves a call to an external contract (e.g., `IFulfillHelper.execute`), the gas limit of the transaction could be exceeded, causing it to fail.

   **Impact:**  
   Transactions could fail due to insufficient gas, leading to failed fulfillments or cancellations.

   **Mitigation:**  
   ```solidity
   // Use a pull-over-push pattern or implement a gas forwarding mechanism.
   // Example:
   // function fulfill(TransactionData calldata txData, uint256 relayerFee, bytes calldata signature) external override nonReentrant {
   //   uint256 gasFee = txData.amount * gasPrice;
   //   uint256 totalGas = txData.amount * gasPrice + gasFee;
   //   require(gasleft() >= totalGas, ""Insufficient gas"");
   //   // Proceed with transaction logic
   // }
   ```

4. **Reentrancy Vulnerability** *(High)*:  
   **Description:**  
   The contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks in the `fulfill` function, particularly when transferring assets using `LibAsset.transferAsset` or `LibERC20.transferFrom`. If the receiving contract calls back into the `TransactionManager` before the state is updated, it could exploit the contract.

   **Impact:**  
   An attacker could drain funds or manipulate the contract's state by repeatedly calling it during a transaction.

   **Mitigation:**  
   ```solidity
   // Use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern.
   // Example:
   // function fulfill(TransactionData calldata txData, uint256 relayerFee, bytes calldata signature) external override nonReentrant {
   //   uint256 amount = txData.amount;
   //   uint256 toRefund = amount - relayerFee;
   //   require(amount > 0, ""Amount is zero"");
   //   require(relayerFee <= amount, ""Invalid relayer fee"");

   //   // Update state before external calls
   //   routerBalances[txData.router][txData.receivingAssetId] += amount;

   //   // External calls after state updates
   //   require(LibAsset.transferAsset(txData.receivingAssetId, payable(txData.receivingAddress), amount), ""Transfer failed"");
   // }
   ```

5. **Signature Malformed Handling** *(Medium)*:  
   **Description:**  
   The contract does not validate the signature's structure or contents. Malformed signatures could bypass the signature validation, allowing unauthorized actions.

   **Impact:**  
   Malicious users could exploit malformed signatures to fulfill or cancel transactions without proper authorization.

   **Mitigation:**  
   ```solidity
   // Validate the signature structure and contents before using it.
   // Example:
   // require(signature.length ==","### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

### **[H-01] Anyone can arbitrarily add router liquidity**

**Report Description**:  
The `addLiquidity()` function allows anyone to add liquidity on behalf of a router by transferring ERC20 tokens from the router's address to the contract. This lack of access control could lead to unauthorized increases in the router's exposure to protocol risk, as anyone can move tokens from the router's address if the router has granted max approval to the contract.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of unauthorized liquidity addition or the lack of access control in the `addLiquidity()` function. This is a critical oversight, as it leaves the contract vulnerable to unauthorized token transfers and increased protocol risk for routers.

---

### **[H-02] `activeTransactionBlocks` are vulnerable to DDoS attacks**

**Report Description**:  
The `activeTransactionBlocks` array can grow indefinitely, making the `removeUserActiveBlocks` function vulnerable to gas limit issues and DDoS attacks. A malicious actor could repeatedly call the `prepare` function with zero amounts to inflate the array, blocking legitimate transactions and consuming excessive gas.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the DDoS vulnerability or the gas inefficiency in the `removeUserActiveBlocks` function. This is a significant gap, as it leaves the contract vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks and inefficient gas usage.

---

### **[H-03] Router liquidity on receiving chain can be double-dipped by the user**

**Report Description**:  
During the `fulfill()` function, if both `IFulfillHelper.addFunds()` and `IFulfillHelper.execute()` fail, the `toSend` amount is transferred twice to the `receivingAddress`. This could lead to double-dipping of router liquidity on the receiving chain.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the double-dipping issue in the `fulfill()` function. This is a critical oversight, as it could lead to unintended transfers and loss of router liquidity.

---

### **[H-04] Expired transfers will lock user funds on the sending chain**

**Report Description**:  
The `cancel()` function pays the relayer in `receivingAssetId` on the sending chain instead of `sendingAssetID`. If `receivingAssetId` does not exist on the sending chain, the cancel transaction will revert, locking user funds indefinitely.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of incorrect asset payment in the `cancel()` function. This is a significant oversight, as it could lead to permanent locking of user funds.

---

### **[H-05] Approval is not reset if the call to `IFulfillHelper` fails**

**Report Description**:  
The `fulfill` function approves the `callTo` address to transfer `toSend` tokens but does not reset the approval if the call to `IFulfillHelper` fails. This could allow a malicious `callTo` to pull tokens later.

**Match in Response List**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response list identifies a reentrancy vulnerability in the `fulfill` function but does not specifically address the issue of unreset approvals.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. While the response list correctly identifies a reentrancy vulnerability, it does not explicitly address the issue of unreset approvals, which is a critical aspect of the reported issue.

---

### **[M-01] Signatures use only tx ID instead of entire digest**

**Report Description**:  
The signature check in `recoverFulfillSignature()` uses only the transaction ID, which could lead to signature replay attacks if the same transaction ID is reused with different relayer fees.

**Match in Response List**:  
**Correct**. The response list identifies the signature replay attack issue and suggests adding a nonce or chain-specific identifier to the message hash.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the signature replay vulnerability and proposes a mitigation strategy that aligns with the reported issue.

---

### **[M-02] Malicious router can block cross-chain-transfers**

**Report Description**:  
A malicious router could block cross-chain transfers by bidding on user transactions off-chain and then either not responding or responding with a `prepare` transaction of `amount=0`. This would lock user funds for the entire expiry time without the router locking up any assets.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of malicious routers blocking cross-chain transfers. This is a significant oversight, as it leaves the protocol vulnerable to abuse by malicious routers.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:

- **[M-01] Signatures use only tx ID instead of entire digest**

**Partially Correct Matches**:

- **[H-05] Approval is not reset if the call to `IFulfillHelper` fails**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:

- **[H-01] Anyone can arbitrarily add router liquidity**
- **[H-02] `activeTransactionBlocks` are vulnerable to DDoS attacks**
- **[H-03] Router liquidity on receiving chain can be double-dipped by the user**
- **[H-04] Expired transfers will lock user funds on the sending chain**
- **[M-02] Malicious router can block cross-chain-transfers**

---

### **Conclusion**

The response list addresses only one issue (**[M-01]**) correctly and partially addresses another (**[H-05]**). However, it misses five critical issues, leaving the contract vulnerable to unauthorized liquidity addition, DDoS attacks, double-dipping of router liquidity, locking of user funds, and malicious router behavior. Significant improvements are needed to ensure comprehensive coverage of the reported vulnerabilities.",3,2,2,14,"```
1. Signatures use only tx ID instead of entire digest
```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the ranks at which the true positives appear in the ranked list of predictions**:
   - The true positive is: ""Signatures use only tx ID instead of entire digest"".
   - We need to check if this true positive appears in the ranked list of predictions.

2. **Calculate the precision at the rank where the true positive appears**:
   - If the true positive appears at rank \( k \), then \( P@k = \frac{\text{Number of true positives up to rank } k}{k} \).

3. **Average the precision values for all true positives**:
   - Since there is only one true positive, the AP will be the precision at the rank where it appears.

### Analysis:
- The true positive ""Signatures use only tx ID instead of entire digest"" does not explicitly appear in the ranked list of predictions provided. Therefore, it is not present in the ranked list.

### Conclusion:
Since the true positive does not appear in the ranked list of predictions, the **Average Precision (AP)** is:
