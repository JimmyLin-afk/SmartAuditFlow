}",2733,263,"[H-01] Arbitrary contract call allows attackers to steal ERC20 from users' wallets
A call to an arbitrary contract with custom calldata is made in `fillZrxQuote()`, which means the contract can be an ERC20 token, and the calldata can be `transferFrom` a previously approved user.
  [H-02] Wrong calculation of erc20Delta and ethDelta
“function fillZrxQuote()”
When a user tries to swap unwrapped ETH to ERC20, even if there is a certain amount of ETH refunded, at L215, `ethDelta` will always be 0.
That's because `originalETHBalance` already includes the `msg.value` sent by the caller.
Let's say the ETH balance of the contract is 1 ETH before the swap.
- A user swaps 10 ETH to USDC;
- `originalETHBalance` will be 11 ETH;
- If there is 1 ETH of refund;
- `ethDelta` will be 0 as the new balance is 2 ETH and `subOrZero(2, 11)` is 0.
Similarly, erc20Delta is also computed wrong.
Consider a special case of a user trying to arbitrage from WBTC to WBTC, the `originalERC20Balance` already includes the input amount, erc20Delta will always be much lower than the actual delta amount.
For example, for an arb swap from 1 WBTC to 1.1 WBTC, the ethDelta will be 0.1 WBTC while it should be 1.1 WBTC.
  [M-01] Swap.sol implements potentially dangerous transfer
The use of `transfer()` in  Swap.sol may have unintended outcomes on the eth being sent to the receiver. Eth may be irretrievable or undelivered if the msg.sender or feeRecipient is a smart contract. Funds can potentially be lost if;
The smart contract fails to implement the payable fallback function
The fallback function uses more than 2300 gas units
The latter situation may occur in the instance of gas cost changes. The impact would mean that any contracts receiving funds would potentially be unable to retrieve funds from the swap.   [M-02] Unused ERC20 tokens are not refunded
Based on the context and comments in the code, we assume that it's possible that there will be some leftover sell tokens, not only when users are selling unwrapped ETH but also for ERC20 tokens.
However, in the current implementation, only refunded ETH is returned (L158).
Because of this, the leftover tkoens may be left in the contract unintentionally.
 
[M-03] Users can avoid paying fees for ETH swaps
Users can call `Swap.swapByQuote()` to execute an ETH swap (where they receive ETH) without paying swap fee for the gained ETH. They can trick the system by setting `zrxBuyTokenAddress` to an address of a malicious contract and making it think they have executed an ERC20 swap when they have actually executed an ETH swap. In this case, the system will give them the ETH they got from the swap (`boughtETHAmount`) without charging any swap fees for it, because the systems consideres this ETH as ""refunded ETH"" that wasn't part of the ""ERC20"" swap.",5,"pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

**[H-01] Arbitrary contract call allows attackers to steal ERC20 from users' wallets**

**Report Description**:
The `fillZrxQuote()` function makes a call to an arbitrary contract with custom calldata, which could be an ERC20 token with `transferFrom` calldata targeting a previously approved user. This allows attackers to steal ERC20 tokens from users' wallets.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of arbitrary contract calls or the potential for ERC20 token theft. This is a critical vulnerability that is entirely missed in the response list.

---

**[H-02] Wrong calculation of `erc20Delta` and `ethDelta`**

**Report Description**:
The `fillZrxQuote()` function incorrectly calculates `erc20Delta` and `ethDelta`. For ETH swaps, `ethDelta` is always `0` because `originalETHBalance` already includes `msg.value`. Similarly, `erc20Delta` is miscalculated when swapping between the same token (e.g., WBTC to WBTC), leading to incorrect delta amounts.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of incorrect calculations for `erc20Delta` and `ethDelta`. This is a significant oversight, as it directly impacts the contract's functionality and user funds.

---

**[M-01] Swap.sol implements potentially dangerous transfer**

**Report Description**:
The use of `transfer()` in `Swap.sol` may lead to unintended outcomes when sending ETH to smart contracts. If the recipient contract's fallback function uses more than 2300 gas or is not payable, funds may be lost. This is particularly risky in the context of gas cost changes.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of using `transfer()` for ETH transfers and the associated risks. This is a medium-severity issue that is entirely missed.

---

**[M-02] Unused ERC20 tokens are not refunded**

**Report Description**:
The contract does not refund unused ERC20 tokens after a swap. While refunded ETH is returned, leftover ERC20 tokens remain in the contract, potentially leading to unintended token accumulation.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of unused ERC20 tokens not being refunded. This is a medium-severity issue that is entirely missed.

---

**[M-03] Users can avoid paying fees for ETH swaps**

**Report Description**:
Users can call `Swap.swapByQuote()` to execute an ETH swap without paying swap fees by tricking the system into thinking it's an ERC20 swap. This is done by setting `zrxBuyTokenAddress` to a malicious contract address, allowing users to receive ETH without paying fees.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of users avoiding swap fees for ETH swaps. This is a medium-severity issue that is entirely missed.

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:
- **[H-01] Arbitrary contract call allows attackers to steal ERC20 from users' wallets**
- **[H-02] Wrong calculation of `erc20Delta` and `ethDelta`**
- **[M-01] Swap.sol implements potentially dangerous transfer**

### **Conclusion**
The response list fails to address any of the issues reported in the `issue` list. This indicates a significant gap in the coverage, accuracy, and sufficiency of the responses. The issues range from high-severity vulnerabilities (e.g., arbitrary contract calls and incorrect calculations) to medium-severity risks (e.g., dangerous transfers and fee avoidance), all of which are critical to the security and functionality of the smart contract. The response list should be revised to address these issues comprehensively.",0,2,3,3,6,78,"```
