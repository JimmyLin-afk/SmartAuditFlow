**[H-01] YaxisVaultAdapter.sol#withdraw() will most certainly fail**

**Report Description**:
The `withdraw` function in `YaxisVaultAdapter.sol` is likely to fail due to precision loss in the `_tokensToShares()` function and the `vault.withdraw()` function. This precision loss results in the actual token amount withdrawn being less than the specified `_amount`. Consequently, the `safeTransfer` call to transfer `_amount` to the recipient will revert due to insufficient balance. Based on simulations, this failure occurs 99.99% of the time unless the price per share (`pps`) equals `1e18`.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. None of the responses in the `response_list` address the issue of precision loss in the `withdraw` function or the resulting insufficient balance problem. The responses focus on reentrancy, access control, unlimited approvals, event emissions, and deprecated Solidity versions, none of which are relevant to the described issue. The core vulnerability—precision loss leading to failed transfers—is entirely missed.
