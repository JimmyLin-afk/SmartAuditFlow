}",3028.0,374.0,"[H-01] Vault fails to track debt correctly that leads to bad debt
Arithmetic issue in function `borrow`
It's similar to the issue ""misuse amount as increasing debt in the vault contract"". Similar issue in a different place that leads to different exploit patterns and severity.
When users borrow usdm from a vault, the debt increases by the `amount * 1.005`.
    “uint256 increasingDebt = (_amount * 1005) / 1000;”
However, when the contract records the total debt it uses _amount instead of increasingDebt.
```details[_id].debtIndex =
    (details[_id].debtIndex * (totalDebt)) /
    (details[_id].debt + _amount);
details[_id].debt = totalDebt;
details[_id].status = Status.Active;
debts += _amount;```
  [H-05] debts calculation is not accurate
The value of the global variable `debts` in the contract MochiVault.sol is calculated in an inconsistent way.
In the function `borrow()` the variable `debts` is increased with a value excluding the fee. However in `repay()` and `liquidate()` it is decreased with the same value as `details[_id].debt` is decreased, which is including the fee.
This would mean that `debts` will end up in a negative value when all debts are repay-ed. Luckily the function repay() prevents this from happening.
In the meantime the value of debts isn't accurate. This value is used directly or indirectly in:
- `liveDebtIndex()`, `accrueDebt()`, currentDebt() of MochiVault.sol This means the entire debt and claimable calculations are slightly off. 
 [H-08] Anyone can extend withdraw wait period by depositing zero collateral
In MochiVault.sol, the `deposit` function allows anyone to deposit collateral into any position. A malicious user can call this function with amount = 0, which would reset the amount of time the owner has to wait before they can withdraw their collateral from their position. This is especially troublesome with longer delays, as a malicious user would only have to spend a little gas to lock out all other users from being able to withdraw from their positions, compromising the functionality of the contract altogether.
 
[M-04] Unchecked ERC20 transfer calls
ERC20 `transfer` and `transferFrom` calls normally return `true` on a succesful transfer. In DutchAuctionLiquidator the call `asset.transfer(msg.sender, _collateral);` is made. `asset` refers to whichever ERC20 asset is used for the vault of that auction. If asset is an ERC20 token which does not comply with the EIP-20 standard it might return false on a failed transaction rather than revert. In this case it would count as a valid transaction even though it is not. If a vault would be making use of USDT the transfer call would always revert as USDT returns void on transfers.
There are a few more transfer(From) calls which are unchecked, these are however all on a predetermined asset (mochi, usdM and crv) and unlikely to cause problems.
  [M-10] griefing attack to block withdraws
Every time you deposit some assets in the vault (via `deposit()` of MochiVault.sol) then ""lastDeposit[_id]"" is set to `block.timestamp`. The modifier wait() checks this value and makes sure you cannot withdraw for ""delay()"" blocks. The default value for delay() is 3 minutes.
Knowing this delay you can do a griefing attack: On chains with low gas fees: every 3 minutes deposit a tiny amount for a specific NFT-id (which has a large amount of assets). On chains with high gas fees: monitor the mempool for a `withdraw()` transaction and frontrun it with a `deposit()`",5.0,"pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

---

**[H-01] Vault fails to track debt correctly that leads to bad debt**

**Report Description**:
The `borrow` function in the vault contract incorrectly calculates the debt. The debt increases by `amount * 1.005`, but the total debt is recorded using `_amount` instead of `increasingDebt`. This inconsistency leads to incorrect debt tracking, which could result in bad debt and exploit patterns.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this specific arithmetic issue in the `borrow` function. The issue of incorrect debt tracking and its potential impact on the system is not covered.

---

**[H-05] `debts` calculation is not accurate**

**Report Description**:
The global variable `debts` in `MochiVault.sol` is calculated inconsistently. In the `borrow` function, `debts` is increased without including the fee, while in `repay` and `liquidate`, it is decreased with the fee included. This inconsistency leads to inaccurate debt calculations, affecting functions like `liveDebtIndex`, `accrueDebt`, and `currentDebt`.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the inconsistency in the `debts` calculation. The issue of inaccurate debt tracking and its impact on other functions is not covered.

---

**[H-08] Anyone can extend withdraw wait period by depositing zero collateral**

**Report Description**:
The `deposit` function in `MochiVault.sol` allows anyone to deposit zero collateral, resetting the withdraw wait period for any position. This can be exploited by malicious users to lock out other users from withdrawing their collateral, compromising the contract's functionality.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this specific issue of resetting the withdraw wait period by depositing zero collateral. The potential for a griefing attack is not covered.

---

**[M-04] Unchecked ERC20 transfer calls**

**Report Description**:
The `asset.transfer` call in `DutchAuctionLiquidator` is unchecked, meaning it does not verify the return value. If the ERC20 token does not comply with the EIP-20 standard (e.g., USDT), the transfer could fail silently, leading to incorrect transaction validation.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of unchecked ERC20 transfer calls. The risk of silent failures with non-compliant tokens is not covered.

---

**[M-10] Griefing attack to block withdraws**

**Report Description**:
The `deposit` function in `MochiVault.sol` sets `lastDeposit[_id]` to `block.timestamp`, which is used by the `wait` modifier to enforce a withdraw delay. A malicious user can exploit this by depositing a tiny amount every 3 minutes (or frontrunning withdraw transactions) to block other users from withdrawing their assets.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this specific griefing attack vector. The potential for blocking withdraws through repeated deposits is not covered.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:
- **[H-01] Vault fails to track debt correctly that leads to bad debt**
- **[H-05] `debts` calculation is not accurate**
- **[H-08] Anyone can extend withdraw wait period by depositing zero collateral**
- **[M-04] Unchecked ERC20 transfer calls**
- **[M-10] Griefing attack to block withdraws**

---

### **Conclusion**
The `response_list` does not adequately address the issues raised in the `issue` report. Several critical vulnerabilities, including arithmetic issues, inconsistent debt calculations, unchecked ERC20 transfers, and griefing attacks, are not covered. The response list focuses on general issues like access control, reentrancy, and integer overflow but misses the specific vulnerabilities detailed in the `issue` report.",0,0,5,6.0,33.0,"```

```  [H-11] treasuryShare is Overwritten in FeePoolV0._shareMochi()
Function `_shareMochi()`  overwritten `treasuryShare`
The FeePoolV0.sol contract accrues fees upon the liquidation of undercollaterised positions. These fees are split between treasury and vMochi contracts. However, when `distributeMochi()` is called to distribute mochi tokens to veCRV holders, both mochiShare and treasuryShare is flushed from the contract when there are still usdm tokens in the contract.
  [H-12] feePool is vulnerable to sandwich attack.
There's a permissionless function `distributeMochi` in FeePoolV0.sol L55-L62. Since everyone can trigger this function, an attacker can launch a sandwich attack with flashloan to steal the funds.
The devs have mentioned this concern in the comment. An attacker can steal the funds with a flash loan attack.
Attackers can steal all the funds in the pool. I consider this is a high-risk issue.",3.0,"pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

**[H-02] `FeePoolV0.sol#distributeMochi()` will unexpectedly flush `treasuryShare`, causing the protocol fee cannot be properly accounted for and collected**

**Report Description**:
The `distributeMochi()` function in `FeePoolV0.sol` is designed to convert `mochiShare` to Mochi tokens and distribute them to the vMochi Vault and veCRV Holders. However, the function unexpectedly resets `treasuryShare` to `0`, which is not intended. This behavior prevents the protocol fee from being properly accounted for and collected, leading to potential financial discrepancies.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of `treasuryShare` being unexpectedly reset to `0`. This is a critical oversight that directly impacts the protocol's ability to account for and collect fees.

---

**[H-11] `treasuryShare` is Overwritten in `FeePoolV0._shareMochi()`**

**Report Description**:
The `_shareMochi()` function in `FeePoolV0.sol` overwrites `treasuryShare` to `0` when distributing Mochi tokens. This is problematic because the contract accrues fees from liquidations, and `treasuryShare` should not be reset while there are still `usdm` tokens in the contract. This behavior can lead to financial mismanagement and loss of protocol fees.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of `treasuryShare` being overwritten in the `_shareMochi()` function. This is a significant oversight that affects the protocol's financial integrity.

---

**[H-12] `FeePoolV0.sol` is vulnerable to sandwich attack**

**Report Description**:
The `distributeMochi` function in `FeePoolV0.sol` is permissionless, allowing anyone to trigger it. This makes the contract vulnerable to a sandwich attack, where an attacker can use a flash loan to manipulate the price of Mochi tokens and steal funds from the pool. This is a high-risk issue that could result in significant financial losses.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Missing Access Control on `distributeMochi` Function""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response correctly identifies the lack of access control on the `distributeMochi` function, which is a critical part of the vulnerability. However, it does not mention the specific risk of a sandwich attack or the potential for financial loss due to flash loan manipulation. This omission makes the response partially correct.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:
- **[H-12] `FeePoolV0.sol` is vulnerable to sandwich attack**

**Partially Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:
- **[H-02] `FeePoolV0.sol#distributeMochi()` will unexpectedly flush `treasuryShare`, causing the protocol fee cannot be properly accounted for and collected**
- **[H-11] `treasuryShare` is Overwritten in `FeePoolV0._shareMochi()`**

---

### **Conclusion**
The response list partially addresses one of the issues ([H-12]) but misses the other two critical issues ([H-02] and [H-11]). The lack of coverage for these issues indicates a significant gap in the response list's ability to address the vulnerabilities and risks identified in the issue report.",1,2,0,8.0,29.0,"```

**Report Description**:
In `ReferralFeePoolV0.sol#claimRewardAsMochi()`, the `path` array is initialized with a length of 2 but attempts to assign three elements (`path[0]`, `path[1]`, and `path[2]`). This results in an out-of-bounds exception at runtime, causing the transaction to revert. The impact is that the `claimRewardAsMochi()` function will fail, preventing users from claiming referral fees and potentially locking funds in the contract.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Incorrect Path Length in claimRewardAsMochi""**.

**Validation**:
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue with the incorrect initialization of the `path` array, which leads to an out-of-bounds exception. The description and impact align with the issue report, and the severity is appropriately marked as critical.

---

### **[H-06] Referrer can drain ReferralFeePoolV0**

**Report Description**:
The `claimRewardAsMochi` function in `ReferralFeePoolV0.sol` does not reduce the user's reward balance after claiming. This oversight allows a referrer to repeatedly claim the same reward, potentially draining the fee pool.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Missed Issue**. The response list does not address the issue of the reward balance not being reduced after claiming, which is a critical vulnerability allowing for the draining of the fee pool.

### **[M-02] ReferralFeePoolV0 is vulnerable to MEV searcher**

**Report Description**:
The `claimRewardAsMochi` function in `ReferralFeePoolV0` ignores slippage control when swapping tokens. This makes the contract vulnerable to MEV (Miner Extractable Value) searchers, who could exploit the lack of slippage control to sandwich users, resulting in significant financial losses.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Lack of Minimum Output Tokens Check in swapExactTokensForTokens""**.

**Validation**:
**Correct**. The response identifies the issue of insufficient slippage control by noting that `amountOutMin` is set to 1, which is too low. However, it does not explicitly mention the broader risk of MEV searchers or sandwich attacks, which is a critical aspect of the issue.

**[H-04] `registerAsset()` can overwrite `_assetClass` value**

**Report Description**:
The `registerAsset()` function in `MochiProfileV0.sol` allows anyone to call it, assuming the asset meets liquidity requirements. This function can reset the `_assetClass` of an already registered asset to `AssetClass.Sigma`. Changing the `_assetClass` affects multiple functions (`liquidationFactor()`, `riskFactor()`, `maxCollateralFactor()`, `liquidationFee()`, `keeperFee()`, `maxFee()`), altering the behavior of the entire vault. This could lead to unintended liquidations or other operational discrepancies.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Lack of Access Control on registerAsset Function""**.

**Validation**:
**Correct**. The response correctly identifies the lack of access control in the `registerAsset` function, which aligns with the issue's core problem. However, the response does not address the specific risk of overwriting the `_assetClass` value and its cascading effects on the vault's behavior. This omission makes the response partially correct, as it misses critical details about the vulnerability's impact.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:
- **[H-04] `registerAsset()` can overwrite `_assetClass` value**

**Partially Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:
- *None*

--- 

**Analysis**:
The response list partially addresses the issue by identifying the lack of access control in the `registerAsset` function. However, it fails to fully capture the specific risk of overwriting the `_assetClass` value and its broader implications on the vault's behavior. This gap highlights the need for more detailed analysis in the response to ensure all aspects of the vulnerability are covered.",1,0,0,6.0,61.0,"```
1. Lack of Access Control on registerAsset Function
```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the rank of the true positive**:
   - The true positive is ""Lack of Access Control on registerAsset Function"".
   - This finding appears at **rank 1** in the ranked list of predictions.

2. **Calculate the precision at that rank**:
   - Precision at rank 1 (\( P@1 \)) is calculated as the number of true positives up to rank 1 divided by the total number of predictions up to rank 1.
   - \( P@1 = \frac{1}{1} = 1.0 \)

3. **Compute the Average Precision (AP)**:
   - Since there is only one true positive, the AP is simply the precision at that rank.
   - \( AP = 1.0 \)

---

#### **[H-09] Treasury is Vulnerable to Sandwich Attack**

**Report Description**:  
The permissionless function `veCRVlock` in `MochiTreasury` allows anyone to trigger it, enabling attackers to launch a sandwich attack using flash loans to steal funds. This vulnerability could result in the theft of all funds in the treasury, making it a high-risk issue.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Insufficient Access Control on Critical Functions""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response correctly identifies the lack of access control in the `veCRVlock` function, which is a critical aspect of the vulnerability. However, it does not explicitly address the sandwich attack vector or the use of flash loans, which are central to the reported issue. While the response highlights the risk of unauthorized access, it misses the specific exploitation mechanism described in the issue.

---

#### **[M-14] MochiTreasuryV0.withdrawLock() Is Callable When Locking Has Been Toggled**

**Report Description**:  
The `withdrawLock()` function does not prevent users from calling it when locking has been toggled. This oversight could lead to unexpected withdrawals, potentially compromising the treasury's intended behavior.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Insufficient Access Control on Critical Functions""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the lack of access control in the `withdrawLock()` function, which aligns with the reported issue. It correctly highlights the risk of unauthorized withdrawals and the potential for fund mismanagement, addressing the core concern of the issue.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:   - **[H-09] Treasury is Vulnerable to Sandwich Attack**
- **[M-14] MochiTreasuryV0.withdrawLock() Is Callable When Locking Has Been Toggled**

**Partially Correct Matches**:  
- *None*

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:  
- *None*

---

### **Analysis of Coverage, Accuracy, and Sufficiency**

1. **Coverage**:  
   The response list covers both issues in the report, albeit with varying degrees of detail. The issue of insufficient access control is well-addressed, but the specific exploitation mechanism of the sandwich attack is not fully explored.

2. **Accuracy**:  
   The responses are accurate in identifying the lack of access control as a critical vulnerability. However, the partial match for the sandwich attack issue indicates a gap in addressing the specific attack vector.

3. **Sufficiency**:  
   While the responses are sufficient to highlight the risks associated with unauthorized access, they could be improved by including more detailed explanations of the exploitation mechanisms, such as the use of flash loans in sandwich attacks.

---

### **Recommendations**

- **Enhance Specificity**: For issues like the sandwich attack, include details about the exploitation mechanism (e.g., flash loans) to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability.
- **Expand on Impact**: Elaborate on the potential consequences of vulnerabilities, such as the theft of all treasury funds, to emphasize their severity.
- **Address All Aspects**: Ensure that responses cover not only the root cause of vulnerabilities but also their exploitation methods and potential impacts.",2,0,0,6.0,28.0,"```

1. **Identify the ranks at which the true positives appear in the ranked list of predictions**:
   - The true positive ""Insufficient Access Control on Critical Functions"" appears at rank 1 in the ranked list of predictions.

2. **Calculate the precision at that rank**:
   - Precision at rank 1 (\( P@1 \)) is calculated as the number of true positives up to rank 1 divided by the rank itself.

**Report Description**:  
The `MochiEngine` contract allows the operator to change the NFT contract (lines 91-93 in `MochiEngine.sol`). If the NFT contract is changed, all vaults would point to a different NFT address, rendering users unable to access their positions. This would effectively break the entire protocol. The existence of such a function poses a significant risk, as it could lead to catastrophic failure of the protocol.

**Match in Response List**:  
No match found.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. None of the responses in the `response_list` address the specific issue of changing the NFT contract in `MochiEngine` and its potential to break the protocol. While the response titled **""Centralized Governance Control""** discusses the risks of centralized control, it does not specifically mention the NFT contract change or its impact on the protocol's functionality. The other responses (**""Lack of Event Emission for Critical State Changes""** and **""Immutable Vault Factory Initialization""**) are unrelated to this issue. Therefore, the issue is entirely missed in the response list.

**[H-13] Tokens Can Be Stolen By Frontrunning `VestedRewardPool.vest()` and `VestedRewardPool.lock()`**

**Report Description**:
The `VestedRewardPool.sol` contract is a public-facing contract designed to vest tokens for a minimum of 90 days before allowing recipients to withdraw their `mochi`. The `vest()` function does not use `safeTransferFrom()` to ensure that vested tokens are correctly allocated to the recipient. This oversight allows an attacker to frontrun a call to `vest()` and steal the recipient's vested tokens. The same issue applies to the `lock()` function, making it vulnerable to similar frontrunning attacks.

**Match in Response List**:
No match found.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the specific issue of frontrunning vulnerabilities in the `vest()` and `lock()` functions due to the lack of `safeTransferFrom()`. While the response list identifies general access control issues and reentrancy vulnerabilities, it does not cover the critical frontrunning risk described in the issue report. This omission represents a significant gap in the response list's coverage of security concerns.

**[M-12] Anyone can create a vault by directly calling the factory**

**Report Description**:  
In `MochiVaultFactory.sol`, the `deployVault()` function (lines 26-37) lacks permission control, allowing anyone to create a vault. While the transaction would revert when the government tries to deploy such an asset, the protocol recognizes the random vault as valid by comparing the contract's address with the computed address. This could lead to unauthorized vault deployments, potentially causing operational issues or misuse of the protocol.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Lack of Access Control on Vault Deployment""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the lack of access control in the `deployVault` function, which aligns with the reported issue. It correctly highlights the risk of uncontrolled vault deployments, including potential network congestion or resource exhaustion. This matches the core concern of unauthorized vault creation and its implications, as described in the issue report.

1. Lack of Access Control on Vault Deployment
```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the ranks at which the true positives appear in the ranked list of predictions**:
   - The true positive is ""Lack of Access Control on Vault Deployment"".
   - This issue appears at rank 4 in the ranked list of predictions.

2. **Calculate the precision at that rank**:
   - Precision at rank \( k \) (\( P@k \)) is calculated as the number of true positives up to rank \( k \) divided by \( k \).
   - At rank 4, there is 1 true positive.
   - \( P@4 = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \).

3. **Average the precision values for all true positives**:
   - Since there is only one true positive, the AP is simply the precision at that rank.
   - \( AP = 0.25 \).

**Output**:
```
0.25
