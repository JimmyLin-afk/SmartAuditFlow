}",4958.0,481.0,"[H-01] Duplication of Balance
It is possible to duplicate currently held ink or art within a Cauldron, thereby breaking the contract's accounting system and minting units out of thin air.
The `stir` function of the `Cauldron`, which can be invoked via a Ladle operation, caches balances in memory before decrementing and incrementing. As a result, if a transfer to self is performed, the assignment balances[to] = balancesTo will contain the added-to balance instead of the neutral balance.
This allows one to duplicate any number of ink or art units at will, thereby severely affecting the protocol's integrity. A similar attack was exploited in the third bZx hack resulting in a roughly 8 million loss.
Recommend that a require check should be imposed prohibiting the from and to variables to be equivalent.
  [M-01] Potential griefing with DoS by front-running vault creation with same vaultID
The `vaultID` for a new vault being built is required to be specified by the user building a vault via the `build()` function (instead of being assigned by the Cauldron/protocol). An attacker can observe a `build()` as part of a batch transaction in the mempool, identify the vaultID being requested, and front-run that by constructing a malicious batch transaction with only the build operation with that same `vaultID`. The protocol would create a vault with that vaultID and assign the attacker as its owner. More importantly, the valid batch transaction in the mempool, which was front-run, will later fail to create its vault because that vaultID already exists, as per the check on Line180 of Cauldron.sol. As a result, the valid batch transaction fails entirely because of the attacker front-running with the observed `vaultID`. While the attacker gains nothing except the ownership of an empty vault after spending the gas, this could grief the protocol's real users by preventing them from opening a vault and interacting with the protocol in any manner. The rationale for Medium-severity impact: While the likelihood of this may be low, the impact is high because valid vaults from the Yield front-end will never be successfully created and will lead to a DoS against the entire protocol's functioning. So, with low likelihood and high impact, the severity (according to OWASP) is medium.
Alice uses Yield's front-end to create a valid batch transaction. Evil Eve observes that in the mempool and identifies the vaultID of the vault being built by Alice. Eve submits her own batch transaction (without using the front-end) with only a build operation using Alice's vaultID. She uses a higher gas price to front-run Alice's transaction and get's the protocol to assign that vaultID to herself. Alice's batch transaction later fails because the vaultID she requested is already assigned to Eve. Eve can do this for any valid transaction to grief protocol users by wasting her gas to cause DoS.
Recommend mitigating this DoS vector by having the Cauldron assign the vaultID instead of the user specifying it in the build() operation. This would likely require the build() to be a separate non-batch transaction followed by other operations that use the vaultID assigned in build(). Consider the pros/cons of this approach because it will significantly affect the batching/caching logic in Ladle.
Alternatively, consider adding validation logic in Ladle's batching to revert batches that have only build or a subset of the operations that do not make sense to the protocol's operations per valid recipes, which could be an attacker's signature pattern.   [M-05] Uninitialized or Incorrectly set `auctionInterval` may lead to liquidation engine livelock
The `grab()` function in Cauldron is used by the Witch or other liquidation engines to grab vaults that are under-collateralized. To prevent re-grabbing without sufficient time for auctioning collateral/debt, the logic uses an auctionInterval threshold to give a reasonable window to a liquidation engine that has grabbed the vault.
The `grab()` function has a comment on Line 354: ""// Grabbing a vault protects it for a day from being grabbed by another liquidator. All grabbed vaults will be suddenly released on the 7th of February 2106, at 06:28:16 GMT. I can live with that."" indicating a requirement of the `auctionInterval` being equal to one day. This can happen only if the `auctionInterval` is set appropriately. However, this state variable is uninitialized (defaults to 0) and depends on `setAuctionInterval()` being called with the appropriate auctionInterval_ value, which is also not validated. Discussion with the project lead indicated that this comment is incorrect. Nevertheless, it is safer to initialize auctionInterval at declaration to a safe default value instead of the current 0, which will allow liquidation engines to re-grab vaults without making any progress on liquidation auction. It is also good to add a threshold check-in setAuctionInterval() to ensure the new value meets/exceeds a reasonable default value.
The rationale for Medium-severity impact: While the likelihood of this may be low, the impact is high because liquidation engines will keep re-grabbing vaults from each other and potentially result in liquidation bots entering a live-lock situation without making any progress on liquidation auctions. This will result in collateral being stuck and impact the entire protocol's functioning. So, with low likelihood and high impact, the severity (according to OWASP) is medium.",3.0,"pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

#### **[H-01] Duplication of Balance**

**Report Description**:  
The `stir` function in the `Cauldron` contract caches balances in memory before decrementing and incrementing. If a transfer to self is performed, the assignment `balances[to] = balancesTo` will contain the added-to balance instead of the neutral balance. This allows duplication of `ink` or `art` units, breaking the contract's accounting system and minting units out of thin air. A similar attack was exploited in the third bZx hack, resulting in significant losses. The recommendation is to add a `require` check to prevent `from` and `to` variables from being equivalent.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The vulnerability involves improper state handling during self-transfers, which is not covered by any of the findings in the response list. This is a critical oversight, as the issue directly impacts the integrity of the protocol's accounting system.

---

#### **[M-01] Potential Griefing with DoS by Front-Running Vault Creation with Same `vaultID`**

**Report Description**:  
The `build()` function allows users to specify a `vaultID`, which can be front-run by an attacker. An attacker can observe a `build()` transaction in the mempool, identify the `vaultID`, and front-run it by creating a vault with the same `vaultID`. This causes the original transaction to fail, leading to a denial of service (DoS) for legitimate users. The recommendation is to have the `Cauldron` assign `vaultID` instead of allowing user specification, or to add validation logic in `Ladle` to prevent malicious batching.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The vulnerability involves front-running and DoS attacks, which are not covered by any of the findings. This is a significant gap, as the issue impacts the protocol's usability and could lead to widespread disruption.

---

#### **[M-05] Uninitialized or Incorrectly Set `auctionInterval` May Lead to Liquidation Engine Livelock**

**Report Description**:  
The `grab()` function in the `Cauldron` uses an `auctionInterval` to prevent re-grabbing of vaults without sufficient time for auctioning. However, `auctionInterval` is uninitialized (defaults to 0) and not validated in `setAuctionInterval()`. This could lead to liquidation engines re-grabbing vaults without making progress, resulting in a livelock situation. The recommendation is to initialize `auctionInterval` to a safe default value and add validation in `setAuctionInterval()`.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The vulnerability involves improper initialization and validation of a critical state variable, which is not covered by any of the findings. This is a significant oversight, as the issue could lead to collateral being stuck and impact the protocol's functioning.

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:

}",983.0,88.0,"[M-03] Witch can't give back vault after 2x grab
The `witch.sol` contract gets access to a vault via the grab function in case of liquidation. If the witch.sol contract can't sell the debt within a certain amount of time, a second grab can occur.
After the second grab, the information of the original owner of the vault is lost, and the vault can't be returned to the original owner once the debt has been sold.
The `grab` function stores the previous owner in `vaultOwners[vaultId]`, and then the contract itself is the new owner (via `cauldron.grab` and `cauldron._give`). The vaultOwners[vaultId] is overwritten at the second grab
The function buy of Witch.sol tried to give the vault back to the original owner, which won't succeed after a second grab. See the issue page for proof of concept and referenced code
Assuming it's useful to give back the vault to the original owner, recommend making a stack/array of previous owners if multiple instances of the witch.sol contract would be used. Or, check if the witch is already the owner (in the grab function) and keep the vaultOwners[vaultId] if that is the case.
  [M-08] Users can avoid paying borrowing interest after the fyToken matures
According to the protocol design, users have to pay borrowing interest when repaying the debt with underlying tokens after maturity. However, a user can give his vault to Witch and then buy all his collateral using underlying tokens to avoid paying the interest. Besides, this bug could make users less incentivized to repay the debt before maturity and hold the underlying tokens until liquidation.
   (1) A user creates a new vault and opens a borrowing position as usual.
   (2) The maturity date passed. If the user wants to close the position using underlying tokens, he has to pay a borrowing interest (line 350 in Ladle), which is his debt multiplied by the rate accrual (line 373).
   (3) Now, the user wants to avoid paying the borrowing interest. He gives his vault to Witch by calling the function batch of Ladle with the operation GIVE.
   (4) He then calls the function buy of Witch with the corresponding vaultId to buy all his collateral using underlying tokens. In the last step, the `elapsed` time (line 61) is equal to the current timestamp since the vault is never grabbed by Witch before, and thus the auction time of the vault, cauldron.auctions(vaultId), is 0 (the default mapping value). Therefore, the collateral is sold at a price of balances_.art/balances_.ink (line 74). The user can buy balances_.ink amount of collateral using balances_.art but not paying for borrowing fees.
Recommend not allowing users to give vaults to Witch. And to be more careful, requiring vaultOwners[vaultId] and cauldron.auctions(vaultId) to be non-zero at the beginning of function buy.",2.0,"pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

**Report Description**:
The `witch.sol` contract gains access to a vault via the `grab` function during liquidation. If the vault cannot be sold within a certain timeframe, a second `grab` can occur. After the second `grab`, the original owner's information is lost, and the vault cannot be returned to them once the debt is sold. The `grab` function stores the previous owner in `vaultOwners[vaultId]`, but this is overwritten during the second `grab`. The `buy` function attempts to return the vault to the original owner, which fails after a second `grab`. The issue suggests implementing a stack/array of previous owners or checking if the witch is already the owner during the `grab` function to preserve the original owner's information.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of losing the original owner's information after multiple `grab` calls. The findings in the response list focus on access control, reentrancy, division by zero, and event emission, none of which directly relate to the problem of overwriting `vaultOwners[vaultId]` during a second `grab`. This is a missed issue in the response list.

### **[M-08] Users can avoid paying borrowing interest after the fyToken matures**

**Report Description**:
Users are required to pay borrowing interest when repaying debt with underlying tokens after maturity. However, a user can avoid this interest by transferring their vault to `Witch` and then buying their collateral using underlying tokens. This bug could disincentivize users from repaying debt before maturity and encourage holding underlying tokens until liquidation. The issue outlines a sequence of steps where a user avoids paying borrowing interest by leveraging the `GIVE` operation in `Ladle` and the `buy` function in `Witch`. The recommendation is to prevent users from giving vaults to `Witch` and to ensure `vaultOwners[vaultId]` and `cauldron.auctions(vaultId)` are non-zero at the start of the `buy` function.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of users avoiding borrowing interest by transferring vaults to `Witch`. The findings in the response list focus on access control, reentrancy, division by zero, and event emission, none of which directly relate to the problem of circumventing borrowing interest payments. This is another missed issue in the response list.

It is possible for an attacker to intendedly create a fake Join corresponding to a specific token beforehand to make Wand unable to deploy the actual Join, causing a DoS attack.
The address of Join corresponding to an underlying asset is determined as follows and thus unique:
``` Join join = new Join{salt: keccak256(abi.encodePacked(asset))}();

Besides, the function `createJoin` in the contract `JoinFactory` is permissionless: Anyone can create the Join corresponding to the asset.

The attempt of deploying these Joins by Wand would fail since the attacker had occupied the desired addresses with fake Joins, resulting in a DoS attack.
Moreover, the attacker can also perform DoS attacks on newly added assets: He monitors the mempool to find transactions calling the function addAsset of Wand and front-runs them to create the corresponding Join to make the benign transaction fail.",1.0,"pragma solidity >= 0.8.0;

**[M-07] Possible DoS attack when creating Joins in Wand**

**Report Description**:
The issue describes a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack vector in the `Wand` contract. An attacker can preemptively create fake `Join` contracts for specific tokens, preventing the legitimate deployment of `Join` contracts by `Wand`. This is possible because the address of a `Join` contract is uniquely determined by the `asset` using a salt in the `new Join` deployment. Since the `createJoin` function in `JoinFactory` is permissionless, an attacker can deploy fake `Joins` for common assets (e.g., DAI, USDC, ETH) before `Wand` attempts to deploy them. Additionally, the attacker can monitor the mempool for `addAsset` transactions and front-run them to deploy fake `Joins`, causing legitimate transactions to fail. This results in a DoS attack on the system.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Lack of Access Control on createJoin Function""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response correctly identifies the lack of access control on the `createJoin` function, which is a critical part of the issue. However, it does not fully address the specific DoS attack vector described in the report. The response focuses on unauthorized contract creation and potential misuse but misses the core issue of address preemption and the resulting DoS attack. While the response is relevant, it lacks the depth and specificity needed to fully address the reported vulnerability.
