// Outstanding qs:
// - what happens if you have unique user data, but duplicate tx ids?
//   no requires here would catch this, the tx would be properly prepared
//
// - we validate all the inputs but the amount, bidSignature, and encodedBid.
//   bidSignature and encodedBid could be used as slashing later, and their
//   validation is out of scope of this function. But, do we want to be able
//   to use this to send 0-value amounts? basically as some incentivized
//   relayer? would that break bidding?


/// @title TransactionManager
/// @author Connext <support@connext.network>
/// @notice This contract holds the logic to facilitate crosschain transactions.
///         Transactions go through three phases:
///
///         1. Route Auction: User broadcasts to our network signalling their 
///         desired route. Routers respond with sealed bids containing 
///         commitments to fulfilling the transaction within a certain time and 
///         price range.
///
///         2. Prepare: Once the auction is completed, the transaction can be 
///         prepared. The user submits a transaction to `TransactionManager` 
///         contract on sender-side chain containing router's signed bid. This 
///         transaction locks up the users funds on the sending chiain. Upon 
///         detecting an event containing their signed bid from the chain, 
///         router submits the same transaction to `TransactionManager` on the 
///         receiver-side chain, and locks up a corresponding amount of 
///         liquidity. The amount locked on the receiving chain is `sending 
///         amount - auction fee` so the router is incentivized to complete the 
///         transaction.
///
///         3. Fulfill: Upon detecting the `TransactionPrepared` event on the 
///         receiver-side chain, the user signs a message and sends it to a 
///         relayer, who will earn a fee for submission. The relayer (which may 
///         be the router) then submits the message to the `TransactionManager` 
///         to complete their transaction on receiver-side chain and claim the 
///         funds locked by the router. A relayer is used here to allow users 
///         to submit transactions with arbitrary calldata on the receiving 
///         chain without needing gas to do so. The router then submits the 
///         same signed message and completes transaction on sender-side, 
///         unlocking the original `amount`.
///
///         If a transaction is not fulfilled within a fixed timeout, it 
///         reverts and can be reclaimed by the party that called `prepare` on 
///         each chain (initiator). Additionally, transactions can be cancelled 
///         unilaterally by the person owed funds on that chain (router for 
///         sending chain, user for receiving chain) prior to expiry.

}",6657,654,"[H-01] Anyone can arbitrarily add router liquidity
The `addLiquidity()` function takes a router address parameter, whose liquidity is increased (instead of assuming that `router` == `msg.sender` like is done on `removeLiquidity()`) on this contract/chain, by transferring the fund amount from router address to this contract if `assetID` != 0 (i.e. ERC20 tokens). However, anyone can call this function on the router’s behalf. For assetID == 0, the Ether transfer via msg.value comes from msg.sender and hence is assumed to be the router itself.
The impact is that this will allow anyone to call this function and arbitrarily move ERC20 tokens from router address to this contract, assuming router has given max approval to this contract and has assetID amount available for transfer. While the router can always remove the liquidity if it doesn’t want to maintain that level of liquidity, this lack of access control or flexibility for a relayer to add liquidity on router’s behalf, may unnecessarily (and without authorization) increase the router’s exposure to protocol risk to more than it desires. See TransactionManager.sol #L88-L98. See also, use of msg.sender in removeLiquidity (#L88-L98).
  [H-02] `activeTransactionBlocks` are vulnerable to DDoS attacks
There is a potential issue in function `removeUserActiveBlocks` and the for loop inside it. I assume you are aware of block gas limits (they may be less relevant on other chains but still needs to be accounted for), so as there is no limit for `activeTransactionBlocks`, it may grow so large that the for loop may never finish. You should consider introducing an upper limit for `activeTransactionBlocks`. Also, a malicious actor may block any account (DDOS) by just calling `prepare` again and again with 0 amount acting as a router. This will push `activeTransactionBlocks` to the specified user until it is no longer possible to remove them from the array.
This is also a gas issue, as function `removeUserActiveBlocks` iterating and assigning large dynamic arrays is very gas-consuming. Consider optimizing the algorithm, e.g. finding the first occurrence, then swap it with the last item, pop the array, and break. Or maybe even using an EnumerableMap, so you can find and remove elements in O(1).
The best solution depends on what the usual number of `activeTransactionBlocks` is. If it is expected to be low (e.g. less than 5), then the current approach will work. But with larger arrays, I expect EnumerableMap would be more efficient.
Because an upper limit will not fully mitigate this issue, as a malicious actor can still DDOS the user by pushing useless txs until this limit is reached and a valid router may not be able to submit new txs. And, because you need to improve both the security and performance of removeUserActiveBlocks; EnumerableMap may be a go-to solution.
  [H-03] Router liquidity on receiving chain can be double-dipped by the user
During `fulfill()` on the receiving chain, if the user has set up an external contract at `txData.callTo`, the catch blocks for both `IFulfillHelper.addFunds()` and `IFulfillHelper.excute()` perform `transferAsset` to the predetermined fallback address `txData.receivingAddress`.
If `addFunds()` has reverted earlier, `toSend` amount would already have been transferred to the `receivingAddress`. If `execute()` also fails, it is again transferred.
Scenario: User sets up receiver chain `txData.callTo` contract such that both addFunds() and execute() calls revert. That will let him get twice the toSend amount credited to the receivingAddress. So effectively, Alice locks 100 tokenAs on chain A, and can get 200 tokenAs (or twice the amount of any token she is supposed to get on chain B from the router), minus relayer fee, on chain B. Router liquidity is double-dipped by Alice and router loses funds. See TransactionManager.sol L395-L409 and L413-L428.
  [H-04] Expired transfers will lock user funds on the sending chain function `cancel()`
The cancelling relayer is being paid in `receivingAssetId` on the sendingChain instead of in sendingAssetID. If the user relies on a relayer to cancel transactions, and that receivingAssetId asset does not exist on the sending chain (assuming only sendingAssetID on the sending chain and receivingAssetId on the receiving chain are assured to be valid and present), then the cancel transaction from the relayer will always revert and user’s funds will remain locked on the sending chain.
The impact is that expired transfers can never be cancelled and user funds will be locked forever if user relies on a relayer.
Recommend changing receivingAssetId to sendingAssetId in transferAsset() on TransactionManager.sol L514.
 [H-05] Approval is not reset if the call to IFulfillHelper fails
The function `fulfill` first approves the `callTo` to transfer an amount of toSend tokens and tries to call IFulfillHelper, but if the call fails, it transfers these assets directly. However, in such case the approval is not reset, so a malicous callTo can pull these tokens later:   [M-01] Signatures use only tx ID instead of entire digest
The signature check in `recoverFulfillSignature()` only uses transaction ID (along with the relayer fee) which can be accidentally reused by the user, in which case the older signatures with the older relayer fees can be replayed. The signature should be on the entire digest hashInvariantTransactionData(txData) as indicated in the comment on L306.
The impact is that, If the user signatures are indeed on the digest as indicated by the comment, the signature/address check in fulfill() will fail. If not, they may be accidentally/intentionally replayed with same transaction ID, which also appears to be an outstanding question as indicated by the comment on L12.
  [M-02] Malicious router can block cross-chain-transfers
The agreement between the `user` and the `router` seems to already happen off-chain because all the fields are required for the initial In `variantTransactionData call already. A router could pretend to take on a user's cross-chain transfer, the user sends their prepare transaction, locking up funds on the sending chain. But then the router simply doesn't respond or responds with a prepare transaction of amount=0.
The user's funds are then locked for the entire expiry time, whereas the router does not have to lock up anything as the amount is 0, even no gas if they simply don't respond. In this way, a router can bid on everything off-chain without a penalty, and take down everyone that accepts the bid.",7,"pragma solidity 0.8.4;

}",3101,5,2,"The smart contract provided has several potential vulnerabilities. Below is a list of these vulnerabilities:

---

### 1. **Incorrect Handling of `activeTransactionBlocks` in `removeUserActiveBlocks`**
   - **Issue**: The `removeUserActiveBlocks` function does not handle the case where the `preparedBlock` is not found in the `activeTransactionBlocks[user]` array. This could lead to incorrect array manipulation or unexpected behavior.
   - **Impact**: The function may fail silently or produce incorrect results, leading to inconsistencies in the `activeTransactionBlocks` mapping.

---

### 2. **Potential Reentrancy in `fulfill` Function**
   - **Issue**: While the contract uses `nonReentrant` to prevent reentrancy, the `fulfill` function calls external contracts (e.g., `IFulfillHelper(txData.callTo).addFunds` and `IFulfillHelper(txData.callTo).execute`). If these external contracts are malicious or buggy, they could trigger unexpected behavior.
   - **Impact**: Even with `nonReentrant`, external calls could lead to unexpected state changes or loss of funds.

---

### 3. **Insufficient Validation of `relayerFee`**
   - **Issue**: The `relayerFee` is checked to ensure it is less than or equal to `txData.amount`, but there is no validation to ensure it is reasonable or within expected bounds. This could lead to excessive fees or unintended behavior.
   - **Impact**: Users could be charged excessive fees, or the contract logic could fail due to unexpected fee values.

---

### 4. **Incorrect Handling of Expired Transactions in `cancel` Function**
   - **Issue**: The `cancel` function allows the router to cancel a transaction before expiry, but it does not enforce that the router is the only one who can cancel. Additionally, the logic for handling expired transactions is complex and could lead to edge cases.
   - **Impact**: Incorrect handling of expired transactions could result in funds being locked or sent to unintended recipients.

---

### 5. **Lack of Input Validation for `callTo` Address**
   - **Issue**: The `callTo` address in the `fulfill` function is not validated to ensure it is a valid contract address or non-zero address. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors when interacting with the address.
   - **Impact**: Calls to invalid or malicious addresses could result in failed transactions or loss of funds.

---

### 6. **Potential Front-Running in `prepare` Function**
   - **Issue**: The `prepare` function does not include any mechanism to prevent front-running. An attacker could observe a transaction being prepared and submit their own transaction with a higher gas fee to interfere with the intended transaction.
   - **Impact**: Users could lose funds or have their transactions disrupted by malicious actors.

---

### 7. **Incorrect Handling of Ether Transfers**
   - **Issue**: The contract does not explicitly handle the case where Ether is sent to the contract outside of the defined functions (e.g., via `selfdestruct` or direct transfer). This could result in Ether being locked in the contract.
   - **Impact**: Ether sent to the contract outside of the intended functions may become inaccessible.

---

### 8. **Potential Signature Replay Attacks**
   - **Issue**: The `recoverFulfillSignature` and `recoverCancelSignature` functions do not include a mechanism to prevent signature replay attacks (e.g., using a nonce or chain-specific data).
   - **Impact**: An attacker could reuse a valid signature to execute the same transaction multiple times.

---

### 9. **Incorrect Array Length Handling in `removeUserActiveBlocks`**
   - **Issue**: The `removeUserActiveBlocks` function assumes that the `activeTransactionBlocks[user]` array has at least one element. If the array is empty, the function will fail or produce incorrect results.
   - **Impact**: The function may fail or produce unexpected behavior when the array is empty.

---

### 10. **Lack of Validation for `variantTransactionData` in `cancel` Function**
   - **Issue**: The `cancel` function does not validate the `variantTransactionData` mapping to ensure the transaction is in a valid state before cancellation. This could lead to unintended cancellations or state inconsistencies.
   - **Impact**: Transactions could be cancelled incorrectly, leading to loss of funds or inconsistent state.

---

### 11. **Potential Integer Overflow/Underflow**
   - **Issue**: While Solidity 0.8.x has built-in overflow/underflow checks, the contract does not explicitly handle edge cases where arithmetic operations could fail (e.g., subtracting `relayerFee` from `txData.amount`).
   - **Impact**: Arithmetic operations could fail, leading to unexpected behavior or failed transactions.

---

### 12. **Incorrect Handling of `callDataHash` in `fulfill` Function**
   - **Issue**: The `fulfill` function validates the `callDataHash` but does not ensure that the `callData` matches the expected format or is valid for the intended operation.
   - **Impact**: Malicious or invalid `callData` could lead to unexpected behavior or failed transactions.

---

### 13. **Lack of Event Emission for Critical State Changes**
   - **Issue**: Some critical state changes (e.g., updates to `routerBalances` or `variantTransactionData`) are not accompanied by event emissions, making it difficult to track changes or debug issues.
   - **Impact**: Lack of transparency and auditability for critical state changes.

---

### 14. **Incorrect Handling of `receivingAssetId` in `fulfill` Function**
   - **Issue**: The `fulfill` function does not validate the `receivingAssetId` to ensure it is a valid asset ID or non-zero address. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors when transferring assets.
   - **Impact**: Invalid asset IDs could result in failed transactions or loss of funds.

---

### 15. **Potential Gas Limit Issues in `removeUserActiveBlocks` Function**
   - **Issue**: The `removeUserActiveBlocks` function iterates over the `activeTransactionBlocks[user]` array, which could grow large over time. This could lead to gas limit issues or failed transactions.
   - **Impact**: The function may fail or consume excessive gas when processing large arrays.

---

These vulnerabilities highlight areas where the contract could be improved to enhance security, reliability, and functionality.","### **[H-01] Anyone can arbitrarily add router liquidity**

**Report Description**:
The `addLiquidity()` function allows anyone to call it and arbitrarily move ERC20 tokens from the router address to the contract, assuming the router has given max approval to the contract and has the `assetID` amount available for transfer. This lack of access control may unnecessarily increase the router’s exposure to protocol risk beyond its desired level. The issue is particularly problematic for ERC20 tokens, as Ether transfers via `msg.value` are assumed to come from the router itself.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of arbitrary liquidity addition or the lack of access control in the `addLiquidity()` function. This is a critical oversight, as it leaves the router vulnerable to unauthorized liquidity increases.

---

### **[H-02] `activeTransactionBlocks` are vulnerable to DDoS attacks**

**Report Description**:
The `removeUserActiveBlocks` function and its for loop are vulnerable to DDoS attacks due to the lack of an upper limit on `activeTransactionBlocks`. A malicious actor can repeatedly call `prepare` with a 0 amount, pushing `activeTransactionBlocks` to the specified user until it becomes impossible to remove them from the array. This can also lead to gas inefficiencies, as iterating and assigning large dynamic arrays is gas-consuming. The issue could be mitigated by introducing an upper limit or optimizing the algorithm (e.g., using `EnumerableMap`).

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Incorrect Handling of `activeTransactionBlocks` in `removeUserActiveBlocks`""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the issue with `activeTransactionBlocks` but focuses on incorrect array manipulation rather than the DDoS vulnerability or gas inefficiency. It misses the critical aspect of malicious actors exploiting the lack of an upper limit to block accounts.

---

### **[H-03] Router liquidity on receiving chain can be double-dipped by the user**

**Report Description**:
During `fulfill()` on the receiving chain, if the user sets up an external contract at `txData.callTo` such that both `addFunds()` and `execute()` calls revert, the `toSend` amount is transferred twice to the `receivingAddress`. This allows the user to double-dip the router’s liquidity, effectively receiving twice the intended amount of tokens. This results in a loss of funds for the router.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the double-dipping vulnerability in the `fulfill()` function. This is a significant oversight, as it leaves the router exposed to potential fund losses.

---

### **[H-04] Expired transfers will lock user funds on the sending chain**

**Report Description**:
The `cancel()` function pays the cancelling relayer in `receivingAssetId` on the sending chain instead of `sendingAssetId`. If the `receivingAssetId` asset does not exist on the sending chain, the cancel transaction will revert, and the user’s funds will remain locked indefinitely. This issue can be resolved by changing `receivingAssetId` to `sendingAssetId` in the `transferAsset()` function.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Incorrect Handling of Expired Transactions in `cancel` Function""**.

**Validation**:
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue with expired transactions and the incorrect handling of `receivingAssetId` in the `cancel()` function. It correctly highlights the risk of funds being locked due to this oversight.

---

### **[H-05] Approval is not reset if the call to `IFulfillHelper` fails**

**Report Description**:
The `fulfill` function approves the `callTo` address to transfer `toSend` tokens but does not reset the approval if the call to `IFulfillHelper` fails. This allows a malicious `callTo` to pull the approved tokens later, leading to potential loss of funds.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of unreset approvals in the `fulfill` function. This is a critical oversight, as it leaves the contract vulnerable to token theft by malicious `callTo` addresses.

---

### **[M-01] Signatures use only tx ID instead of entire digest**

**Report Description**:
The signature check in `recoverFulfillSignature()` uses only the transaction ID (along with the relayer fee) instead of the entire digest. This allows older signatures with outdated relayer fees to be replayed. The signature should be on the entire digest `hashInvariantTransactionData(txData)` to prevent replay attacks.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential Signature Replay Attacks""**.

**Validation**:
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue of signature replay attacks and the need for additional mechanisms (e.g., nonce or chain-specific data) to prevent them. This aligns with the reported issue.

---

### **[M-02] Malicious router can block cross-chain transfers**

**Report Description**:
A malicious router can block cross-chain transfers by pretending to take on a user’s transfer, locking the user’s funds on the sending chain, and then not responding or responding with a `prepare` transaction of `amount=0`. This allows the router to lock the user’s funds for the entire expiry time without locking up any of its own funds.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of malicious routers blocking cross-chain transfers. This is a significant oversight, as it leaves users vulnerable to fund locking by malicious actors.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:
- **[H-04] Expired transfers will lock user funds on the sending chain**
- **[M-01] Signatures use only tx ID instead of entire digest**

**Partially Correct Matches**:
- **[H-02] `activeTransactionBlocks` are vulnerable to DDoS attacks**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:
- **[H-01] Anyone can arbitrarily add router liquidity**
- **[H-03] Router liquidity on receiving chain can be double-dipped by the user**
- **[H-05] Approval is not reset if the call to `IFulfillHelper` fails**
- **[M-02] Malicious router can block cross-chain transfers**
