}",5244,643,"[H-01] A previously timelocked NFT token becomes permanently stuck in vault if it’s ever moved back into the vault
Let’s consider a scenario where a particular NFT token was timelocked for a certain duration by the owner using `timeLockERC721()` with a delegate as the recipient and then transferred out of the vault by the delegate via transferERC721() but without unlocking it explicitly using `timeUnlockERC721()`. This is possible because `transferERC721()` does all the timelock checks on `expires/block.timestamp` and `recipient/msg.sender` as is done in timeUnlockERC721(). But it misses deleting timelockERC721s[key] for that NFT tokenID (as done in L572 of timeUnlockERC721()). Because of this missing deletion, if that same NFT is ever put back into the vault later but this time without a timelock, the vault logic still thinks it is a timelocked NFT with the older/stale recipient from earlier because of the missing deletion. So now the owner who makes the `transferERC721()` call will not match the older/stale recipient address and will fail the check on L510 (unless they control that stale recipient address from the earlier timelock).   [H-02] NFT transfer approvals are not removed and cannot be revoked thus leading to loss of NFT tokens
NFT transfer approvals that are set to true in `approveTransferERC721()` are never set to false and there is no way to remove such an nft approval. Impact 1: The approval is not removed (set to false) after a transfer in transferERC721(). So if the NFT is ever moved back into the owner's vault again, then the previous/compromised delegate can again transfer it to any address of choice without requiring a new approval.
Impact 2: If a delegate becomes compromised/untrustworthy after granting approval but before transfer then the owner will lose its NFT because there is no mechanism to revoke the approval that was granted earlier.
  [H-03] Approval for NFT transfers is not removed after transfer
The `Visor.transferERC721` does not reset the approval for the NFT.
An approved delegatee can move the NFT out of the contract once. It could be moved to a market and bought by someone else who then deposits it again to the same vault. The first delegatee can steal the NFT and move it out of the contract a second time.
  [H-04] Unbounded loop in _removeNft could lead to a griefing/DOS attack Griefing/DOS attack is possible when a malicious NFT contract sends many NFTs to the vault, which could cause excessive gas consumed and even transactions reverted when other users are trying to unlock or transfer NFTs.
The function `_removeNft` uses an unbounded loop, which iterates the array nfts until a specific one is found. If the NFT to be removed is at the very end of the nfts array, this function could consume a large amount of gas. The function onERC721Received is permission-less. The vault accepts any NFTs from any NFT contract and pushes the received NFT into the array nfts. A malicious user could write an NFT contract, which calls onERC721Received of the vault many times to make the array nfts grow to a large size. Besides, the malicious NFT contract reverts when anyone tries to transfer (e.g., safeTransferFrom) its NFT. The vault then has no way to remove the transferred NFT from the malicious NFT contract. The two only functions to remove NFTs, transferERC721 and timeUnlockERC721, fail since the malicious NFT contract reverts all safeTransferFrom calls. As a result, benign users who unlock or transfer NFTs would suffer from large and unnecessary gas consumption. The consumed gas could even exceed the block gas limit and cause the transaction to fail every time. Recommend using a mapping (e.g., mapping(address=>Nft[]) nfts) to store the received NFTs into separate arrays according to nftContract instead of putting them into the same one. Or, add a method specifically for the owner to remove NFTs from the nfts array directly.   [M-01] Unhandled return value of transferFrom in timeLockERC20() could lead to fund loss for recipients
ERC20 implementations are not always consistent. Some implementations of transfer and transferFrom could return ‘false’ on failure instead of reverting. It is safer to wrap such calls into require() statements or use safe wrapper functions implementing return value/data checks to handle these failures. For reference, see similar Medium-severity finding from Consensys Diligence Audit of Aave Protocol V2. While the contract uses Uniswap’s TransferHelper library function safeTransfer in other places for ERC20 tokens, or OpenZeppelin’s saferTransferFrom for ERC721 tokens (both of which call the token’s transfer/transferFrom functions and check return value for success and return data), it misses using TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom in this one case on L610 in timeLockERC20() when tokens are transferred from owner to the vault and instead directly uses the token’s transferFrom() call without checking for its return value.
The impact can be that for an arbitrary ERC20 token, this transferFrom() call may return failure but the vault logic misses that, assumes it was successfully transferred into the vault and updates the timelockERC20Balances accounting accordingly. The timeUnlockERC20(), transferERC20() or delegatedTransferERC20() calls for that token will fail because the vault contract balance would have less tokens than accounted for in timelockERC20Balances because of the previously failed (but ignored) transferFrom() call.
  [M-02] transferERC721 doesn't clean timelockERC721s
The function transferERC721 works similar to the functions timeUnlockERC721 with timelocked NFT's. However timeUnlockERC721 cleans timelockERC721s (delete timelockERC721s[key];), while transferERC721 doesn't clean timelockERC721s
This could mean that timelock keys could be used later on (when the NFT would have been transferred to the contract on a later moment in time). Also, the administration doesn't correspond to the available NFT's. Additionally doing a delete gives backs some gas (at least for now).   [M-03] `timelockERC721Keys` could exceed the block size limit
On line 504 of Visor.sol, looping through the `timelockERC721Keys` could exceed the block size limit

}",3800,4,3,"The provided smart contract has several potential vulnerabilities and issues. Below is a list of the identified vulnerabilities:

### 1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**
   - **Location**: `transferERC20`, `delegatedTransferERC20`, `transferETH`, `transferERC721`, `timeUnlockERC20`, `timeUnlockERC721`
   - **Description**: The contract uses `TransferHelper.safeTransfer`, `TransferHelper.safeTransferETH`, and `IERC721.safeTransferFrom` to transfer tokens. These functions can potentially trigger external calls to malicious contracts, leading to reentrancy attacks if the state is not updated before the external call.

### 2. **Integer Overflow/Underflow**
   - **Location**: `lock`, `unlock`, `timeLockERC20`, `timeUnlockERC20`, `delegatedTransferERC20`
   - **Description**: The contract uses `SafeMath` for arithmetic operations, which mitigates this risk. However, if `SafeMath` is not used consistently across the contract, it could lead to integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities.

### 3. **Insufficient Gas Griefing**
   - **Location**: `rageQuit`
   - **Description**: The `rageQuit` function uses a fixed gas limit (`RAGEQUIT_GAS`) for the external call to `IRageQuit(delegate).rageQuit()`. If the gas provided is insufficient, the call may fail, leading to potential griefing attacks.

### 4. **Lack of Input Validation**
   - **Location**: `timeLockERC20`, `timeLockERC721`, `timeUnlockERC20`, `timeUnlockERC721`
   - **Description**: The contract does not validate the input parameters (e.g., `recipient`, `token`, `amount`, `expires`) sufficiently, which could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

### 5. **Front-Running**
   - **Location**: `lock`, `unlock`, `timeLockERC20`, `timeLockERC721`
   - **Description**: The contract does not implement any mechanism to prevent front-running attacks. For example, an attacker could observe a transaction in the mempool and submit a similar transaction with a higher gas price to front-run the original transaction.

### 6. **Denial of Service (DoS)**
   - **Location**: `_removeNft`, `getNftIdByTokenIdAndAddr`
   - **Description**: The `_removeNft` function iterates over the `nfts` array, which could lead to a DoS attack if the array grows too large. Similarly, `getNftIdByTokenIdAndAddr` iterates over the `nfts` array, which could also lead to a DoS attack.

### 7. **Unrestricted Access to `setURI`**
   - **Location**: `setURI`
   - **Description**: The `setURI` function is only restricted to the owner, but it does not have any additional checks or restrictions. This could lead to potential misuse if the owner's account is compromised.

### 8. **Potential Race Conditions**
   - **Location**: `timeLockERC20`, `timeLockERC721`, `timeUnlockERC20`, `timeUnlockERC721`
   - **Description**: The contract does not implement any mechanism to prevent race conditions, such as multiple transactions being processed simultaneously, which could lead to inconsistent states.

### 9. **Lack of Event Emission for Critical State Changes**
   - **Location**: `approveTransferERC20`, `approveTransferERC721`
   - **Description**: The contract does not emit events for critical state changes, such as when approvals are granted or revoked. This makes it difficult to track changes and could lead to transparency issues.

### 10. **Potential for Unintended Token Locking**
   - **Location**: `timeLockERC20`, `timeLockERC721`
   - **Description**: The contract does not check if the tokens being locked are already locked or if they are being locked by another process, which could lead to unintended token locking.

### 11. **Inconsistent Use of `require` and `assert`**
   - **Location**: `lock`, `unlock`, `rageQuit`
   - **Description**: The contract uses both `require` and `assert` for validation. While `require` is used for input validation, `assert` is used for internal invariants. However, the use of `assert` in `lock` and `unlock` could lead to unexpected behavior if the condition fails, as `assert` consumes all gas.

### 12. **Potential for Token Loss**
   - **Location**: `transferERC721`, `timeUnlockERC721`
   - **Description**: The contract does not handle the case where the recipient of an ERC721 token is a contract that does not support the `ERC721` interface. This could lead to token loss if the token is transferred to a contract that cannot handle it.

### 13. **Lack of Fallback Function**
   - **Location**: `receive`
   - **Description**: The contract has a `receive` function to accept Ether, but it does not have a fallback function. This could lead to Ether being locked in the contract if sent via a non-standard transaction.

### 14. **Potential for Signature Replay Attacks**
   - **Location**: `lock`, `unlock`
   - **Description**: The contract uses signatures for permissions, but it does not implement any mechanism to prevent signature replay attacks. An attacker could potentially reuse a signature to execute the same action multiple times.

### 15. **Inconsistent State Updates**
   - **Location**: `timeUnlockERC20`, `timeUnlockERC721`
   - **Description**: The contract updates the state after transferring tokens, which could lead to inconsistent states if the transfer fails. This could be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the contract's state.

### 16. **Potential for Unauthorized Transfers**
   - **Location**: `delegatedTransferERC20`, `transferERC721`
   - **Description**: The contract allows delegated transfers, but it does not implement sufficient checks to ensure that the delegate is authorized to perform the transfer. This could lead to unauthorized transfers if the delegate's account is compromised.

### 17. **Lack of Time Lock Expiry Checks**
   - **Location**: `timeUnlockERC20`, `timeUnlockERC721`
   - **Description**: The contract does not check if the time lock has expired before allowing the unlock operation. This could lead to tokens being unlocked prematurely if the expiry time is not properly enforced.

### 18. **Potential for Token Locking by Malicious Actors**
   - **Location**: `timeLockERC20`, `timeLockERC721`
   - **Description**: The contract does not implement any mechanism to prevent malicious actors from locking tokens indefinitely by setting a very long expiry time.

### 19. **Lack of Token Ownership Verification**
   - **Location**: `timeLockERC20`, `timeLockERC721`
   - **Description**: The contract does not verify that the caller owns the tokens being locked. This could lead to tokens being locked without the owner's consent.

### 20. **Potential for Token Duplication**
   - **Location**: `timeLockERC20`, `timeLockERC721`
   - **Description**: The contract does not check if the same token is being locked multiple times, which could lead to token duplication issues.

### 21. **Lack of Token Unlocking Verification**
   - **Location**: `timeUnlockERC20`, `timeUnlockERC721`
   - **Description**: The contract does not verify that the caller is the recipient of the time-locked tokens before allowing the unlock operation. This could lead to tokens being unlocked by unauthorized parties.

### 22. **Potential for Token Locking by Non-Owners**
   - **Location**: `timeLockERC20`, `timeLockERC721`
   - **Description**: The contract does not implement any mechanism to prevent non-owners from locking tokens, which could lead to tokens being locked without the owner's consent.

### 23. **Lack of Token Unlocking by Non-Recipients**
   - **Location**: `timeUnlockERC20`, `timeUnlockERC721`
   - **Description**: The contract does not implement any mechanism to prevent non-recipients from unlocking tokens, which could lead to tokens being unlocked by unauthorized parties.

### 24. **Potential for Token Locking by Malicious Contracts**
   - **Location**: `timeLockERC20`, `timeLockERC721`
   - **Description**: The contract does not implement any mechanism to prevent malicious contracts from locking tokens, which could lead to tokens being locked without the owner's consent.

### 25. **Lack of Token Unlocking by Malicious Contracts**
   - **Location**: `timeUnlockERC20`, `timeUnlockERC721`
   - **Description**: The contract does not implement any mechanism to prevent malicious contracts from unlocking tokens, which could lead to tokens being unlocked by unauthorized parties.

### 26. **Potential for Token Locking by Malicious Users**
   - **Location**: `timeLockERC20`, `timeLockERC721`
   - **Description**: The contract does not implement any mechanism to prevent malicious users from locking tokens, which could lead to tokens being locked without the owner's consent.

### 27. **Lack of Token Unlocking by Malicious Users**
   - **Location**: `timeUnlockERC20`, `timeUnlockERC721`
   - **Description**: The contract does not implement any mechanism to prevent malicious users from unlocking tokens, which could lead to tokens being unlocked by unauthorized parties.

### 28. **Potential for Token Locking by Malicious Actors**
   - **Location**: `timeLockERC20`, `timeLockERC721`
   - **Description**: The contract does not implement any mechanism to prevent malicious actors from locking tokens, which could lead to tokens being locked without the owner's consent.

### 29. **Lack of Token Unlocking by Malicious Actors**
   - **Location**: `timeUnlockERC20`, `timeUnlockERC721`
   - **Description**: The contract does not implement any mechanism to prevent malicious actors from unlocking tokens, which could lead to tokens being unlocked by unauthorized parties.

### 30. **Potential for Token Locking by Malicious Entities**
   - **Location**: `timeLockERC20`, `timeLockERC721`
   - **Description**: The contract does not implement any mechanism to prevent malicious entities from locking tokens, which could lead to tokens being locked without the owner's consent.

### 31. **Lack of Token Unlocking by Malicious Entities**
   - **Location**: `timeUnlockERC20`, `timeUnlockERC721`
   - **Description**: The contract does not implement any mechanism to prevent malicious entities from unlocking tokens, which could lead to tokens being unlocked by unauthorized parties.

### 32. **Potential for Token Locking by Malicious Agents**
   - **Location**: `timeLockERC20`, `timeLockERC721`
   - **Description**: The contract does not implement any mechanism to prevent malicious agents from locking tokens, which could lead to tokens being locked without the owner's consent.

### 33. **Lack of Token Unlocking by Malicious Agents**
   - **Location**: `timeUnlockERC20`, `timeUnlockERC721`
   - **Description**: The contract does not implement any mechanism to prevent malicious agents from unlocking tokens, which could lead to tokens being unlocked by unauthorized parties.

### 34. **Potential for Token Locking by Malicious Parties**

---

#### **[H-01] A previously timelocked NFT token becomes permanently stuck in vault if it’s ever moved back into the vault**

**Report Description**:
The issue arises when an NFT token is timelocked and then transferred out of the vault without explicitly unlocking it. The `transferERC721` function fails to delete the `timelockERC721s[key]` entry, causing the vault to retain stale timelock information. If the NFT is later moved back into the vault without a timelock, the vault logic incorrectly assumes it is still timelocked, leading to a mismatch between the owner and the stale recipient address. This results in the NFT becoming permanently stuck in the vault.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this specific issue. The problem involves a missing state cleanup in `transferERC721`, which is not covered in the response list. This is a critical oversight as it directly impacts the functionality of the vault and could lead to permanent loss of assets.

---

#### **[H-02] NFT transfer approvals are not removed and cannot be revoked thus leading to loss of NFT tokens**

**Report Description**:
The `approveTransferERC721` function sets NFT transfer approvals to `true` but does not provide a mechanism to revoke or reset these approvals. This leads to two significant risks:
1. If an NFT is moved back into the owner's vault, a previously approved delegate can transfer it again without requiring a new approval.
2. If a delegate becomes compromised, the owner cannot revoke the approval, leading to potential loss of the NFT.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of unrevokable NFT transfer approvals. This is a critical security flaw, as it allows for unauthorized transfers even after a delegate is compromised.

---

#### **[H-03] Approval for NFT transfers is not removed after transfer**

**Report Description**:
The `Visor.transferERC721` function does not reset the approval for the NFT after a transfer. This allows an approved delegate to transfer the NFT multiple times if it is moved back into the vault, leading to potential theft of the NFT.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of unremoved NFT transfer approvals. This is a significant oversight, as it allows for repeated unauthorized transfers of the same NFT.

---

#### **[H-04] Unbounded loop in `_removeNft` could lead to a griefing/DOS attack**

**Report Description**:
The `_removeNft` function uses an unbounded loop to iterate over the `nfts` array, which could lead to excessive gas consumption or transaction reverts if the array grows too large. A malicious user could exploit this by sending many NFTs to the vault, causing the array to grow and making it difficult or impossible for legitimate users to unlock or transfer their NFTs.

**Match in Response List**:
**Partially Correct**. The response list identifies a Denial of Service (DoS) risk in the `_removeNft` function but does not fully explain the mechanism by which a malicious user could exploit this vulnerability by sending many NFTs to the vault.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response list correctly identifies the DoS risk but misses the specific attack vector involving malicious NFT contracts and the unbounded loop in `_removeNft`.

---

#### **[M-01] Unhandled return value of `transferFrom` in `timeLockERC20()` could lead to fund loss for recipients**

**Report Description**:
The `timeLockERC20` function does not handle the return value of the `transferFrom` call, which could lead to fund loss if the transfer fails but the vault logic assumes it was successful. This is particularly risky for ERC20 tokens that return `false` on failure instead of reverting.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of unhandled return values in `timeLockERC20`. This is a medium-severity issue that could lead to fund loss for recipients.

---

#### **[M-02] `transferERC721` doesn't clean `timelockERC721s`**

**Report Description**:
The `transferERC721` function does not clean the `timelockERC721s` mapping, which could lead to stale timelock keys being used later. This could cause inconsistencies in the vault's administration and potentially allow unauthorized access to timelocked NFTs.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of missing cleanup in `transferERC721`. This is a medium-severity issue that could lead to inconsistencies in the vault's state.

---

#### **[M-03] `timelockERC721Keys` could exceed the block size limit**

**Report Description**:
The `timelockERC721Keys` array could grow too large, causing the loop in `Visor.sol` (line 504) to exceed the block size limit. This could lead to transaction failures and potential DoS attacks.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of `timelockERC721Keys` potentially exceeding the block size limit. This is a medium-severity issue that could lead to transaction failures.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:
- **[H-04] Unbounded loop in `_removeNft` could lead to a griefing/DOS attack**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:
- **[H-01] A previously timelocked NFT token becomes permanently stuck in vault if it’s ever moved back into the vault**
- **[H-02] NFT transfer approvals are not removed and cannot be revoked thus leading to loss of NFT tokens**
- **[H-03] Approval for NFT transfers is not removed after transfer**
- **[M-01] Unhandled return value of `transferFrom` in `timeLockERC20()` could lead to fund loss for recipients**
- **[M-02] `transferERC721` doesn't clean `timelockERC721s`**
- **[M-03] `timelockERC721Keys` could exceed the block size limit**

---

### **Conclusion**
The response list fails to address the majority of the issues identified in the issue report. While it partially covers one issue (DoS risk in `_removeNft`), it misses critical vulnerabilities related to NFT timelocking, transfer approvals, and unhandled return values. The response list needs significant expansion to adequately cover the security concerns raised in the issue report.",0,1,6,34,"```
