/*
    Source: https://github.com/iearn-finance/yearn-protocol/blob/develop/contracts/vaults/yVault.sol
    
    Changelog:

    V1.1
    * Strategist no longer has special function calling permissions
    * Version function added to contract
    * All write functions, with the exception of transfer, are pausable
    * Keeper or governance can pause
    * Only governance can unpause

    V1.2
    * Transfer functions are now pausable along with all other non-permissioned write functions
    * All permissioned write functions, with the exception of pause() & unpause(), are pausable as well

    V1.3
    * Add guest list functionality
    * All deposits can be optionally gated by external guestList approval logic on set guestList contract

    V1.4
    * Add depositFor() to deposit on the half of other users. That user will then be blockLocked.

    V1.5
    * Removed Controller
        - Removed harvest from vault (only on strategy)
    * Params added to track autocompounded rewards (lifeTimeEarned, lastHarvestedAt, lastHarvestAmount, assetsAtLastHarvest)
      this would work in sync with autoCompoundRatio to help us track harvests better.
    * Fees
        - Strategy would report the autocompounded harvest amount to the vault
        - Calculation performanceFeeGovernance, performanceFeeStrategist, withdrawalFee, managementFee moved to the vault.
        - Vault mints shares for performanceFees and managementFee to the respective recipient (treasury, strategist)
        - withdrawal fees is transferred to the rewards address set
    * Permission:
        - Strategist can now set performance, withdrawal and management fees
        - Governance will determine maxPerformanceFee, maxWithdrawalFee, maxManagementFee that can be set to prevent rug of funds.
    * Strategy would take the actors from the vault it is connected to
    * All governance related fees goes to treasury

The StakedCitadel contract's `balance()` function is supposed to return the balance of the vault + the balance of the strategy. But, it only returns the balance of the vault. The balance is used to determine the number of shares that should be minted when depositing funds into the vault and the number of shares that should be burned when withdrawing funds from it.
Since most of the funds will be located in the strategy, the vault's balance will be very low. Some of the issues that arise from this:

[H-02] StakedCitadel: wrong setupVesting function name
In the `_withdraw` function of the StakedCitadel contract, the setupVesting function of vesting is called, while in the StakedCitadelVester contract, the function name is vest, which will cause the `_withdraw` function to fail, so that the user cannot withdraw the tokens.

[H-03] StakedCitadel depositors can be attacked by the first depositor with depressing of vault token denomination
`deposit()` -> `_depositFor()` -> `_mintSharesFor()` call doesn't require minimum amount and mints according to the provided amount:
Any deposit lower than total attacker's stake will be fully stolen from the depositor as 0 vault tokens will be issued in this case.",3.0,"pragma solidity 0.8.12;

}",4603.0,3,0,"Assessing contract structure
I’m analyzing a solidity contract, focusing on its inheritance from upgradeable frameworks and governance controls. This involves checking initializer and pausable functions, inheritance from SettAccessControl, fee management, and strategy requirements.
Assessing function security
I'm looking into the withdrawToVault function for potential reentrancy risks and ensuring the nonReentrant modifier protects critical functions. Evaluating safeTransferFrom for approval issues and assessing the GuestList and vesting contracts for security concerns.
Examining fee calculations
I’m digging into the potential vulnerability of share miscalculation during fee transfers, specifically with balance() changes after _amount is sent to vesting.
Assessing external risks
I’m weighing the potential security issues in the earn() function with a controlled strategy and token handling reportAdditionalToken(). This leads me to consider external risks carefully.
Assessing potential risks
I’m piecing together the risks of a zero or nearly zero _pool which might cause division by zero or minting an extremely large number of shares.
Evaluating fee handling
I'm assessing _handleFees(), ensuring _pool can only be negative if totalGovernanceFee + feeStrategist > balance(). Solidity version 0.8.12 prevents silent underflow, so no vulnerabilities here.
Evaluating fee vulnerability
I'm assessing the risk of a maliciously large withdrawalFee due to onlyGovernanceOrStrategist setting it to maxWithdrawalFee. This highlights the contract's dependence on trust.
Identifying trust vulnerabilities
I'm examining the relationship dynamics, like governance and strategist setting high fees post-deposit, causing potential rug pulls, and the guestList implementation leading to possible deposit freezes.
Evaluating share management
I'm focusing on _mintSharesFor share management, highlighting risks from low or manipulated balance(). Misuse of managementFee and lack of return checks in withdrawToVault() are also concern points.
Addressing potential issues
I’m mapping out risks from a malicious strategy sending worthless tokens and role mismanagement due to external contract issues in SettAccessControl. Confusing pause and pausedDeposit states also pose a risk.
Navigating inconsistencies
I’m examining pausing logic inconsistencies, notably the separate handling of pause() and pausedDeposit states. This confusion can lead to unexpected contract behavior during certain periods.","Below is a non-exhaustive list of potential vulnerabilities and issues in the provided Solidity contract. Some are explicit technical flaws, while others are trust-related or architectural concerns that may not be strictly classified as “bugs” but can still pose risks.

### 1. Reliance on External Contracts and Trust Model

- **Malicious or faulty external contracts:**  
  The contract delegates critical operations to external contracts:
  - **Strategy (`IStrategy`)**: Funds are transferred to a strategy contract, which is assumed to act in the vault’s best interest. If the strategy is malicious or compromised, it can steal funds, cause incorrect accounting, or fail to return funds on withdrawal.
  - **Guestlist (`IBadgerGuestlist`)**: Deposit authorization depends on an external guest list contract. If this contract malfunctions or is malicious, it can block legitimate deposits or allow unauthorized deposits.
  - **Vesting (`IVesting`)**: Withdrawals route user tokens to a vesting contract. A malicious vesting contract could seize user funds or fail to release them properly.

  While these are known patterns in vault architectures, the correctness and trustworthiness of these external contracts are critical. Any vulnerability or backdoor in them compromises the safety of user funds.

### 2. Governance and Strategist Privilege Risks

- **Unbounded fee setting within allowed caps:**  
  Governance and strategist roles can change performance, management, and withdrawal fees up to their defined maximums. This can effectively allow a “governance rug pull” scenario:
  - They can increase fees to the maximum allowed by the contract’s internal caps.
  - This could heavily dilute users’ shares or make withdrawals extremely costly.
  
  While not a “bug” in code, it’s a major trust issue: users must trust that governance and strategist will act in good faith.

- **Sweeping and withdrawing tokens:**  
  The contract allows governance or strategist to sweep tokens and emit non-protected tokens via the strategy. This can be used to remove non-“want” tokens or handle unexpected assets. However, this power could also be misused.

### 3. Initialization Concerns

- **Public `initialize()` function:**  
  The `initialize()` function is marked `public` and uses the `initializer` modifier. Normally, the upgradeable pattern ensures it can only be called once. If not properly managed at deployment (e.g., if this is a transparent proxy and the deployer fails to call `initialize()` immediately), a malicious actor could front-run and initialize the contract with arbitrary parameters.  
  Although `initializer` provides a safeguard against multiple initializations, careful deployment is critical to prevent “initialization hijack” at the time of deployment.

### 4. Fee and Share Calculation Risks

- **Complex fee minting logic and potential corner cases:**  
  During fee minting (in `_handleFees` or `_withdraw`), the calculation of new shares is done using the formula:
  ```solidity
  shares = (_amount * totalSupply()) / _pool
  ```
  Here, `_pool` is derived from `balance()` (the vault’s total underlying). If the balance is unexpectedly low or manipulated due to external factors (e.g., strategy returns less than expected or acts maliciously), this could:
  - Mint fewer or more shares than intended.
  - Lead to unexpected dilution or incorrect distribution of fees.

  While arithmetic overflows and underflows are no longer silent in Solidity 0.8+, extreme scenarios—like `balance()` being nearly zero when fees are calculated—could revert or result in unintended behavior (e.g., zero shares minted when fees are due).

- **Management fee accrual over long durations:**  
  If a long time passes between harvests, the management fee could become significant, diluting users heavily in a single harvest. This is by design but can be viewed as a centralization/trust concern rather than a direct “bug.”

### 5. Pausing Logic Complexity

- **Dual pausing mechanism (`pausedDeposit` vs. `pause()`):**  
  The contract uses `PausableUpgradeable`’s `pause()` and `unpause()` functions globally, and also uses a separate boolean `pausedDeposit` to specifically control deposits. There’s a risk that these two pause mechanisms become out of sync, leading to confusion:
  - The contract could be globally paused using `pause()`, which prevents certain actions due to `whenNotPaused`.
  - However, `pausedDeposit` is a separate toggle. Some functions (like `earn()`) check only `pausedDeposit` and do not use `whenNotPaused`.
  
  This complexity might allow certain privileged actions even while the contract is globally paused, or cause a misinterpretation of the contract’s actual operational state.

### 6. Dependence on Strategy for Asset Safety

- **Re-entrancy attempts or unexpected calls from the strategy:**  
  Although `nonReentrant` guards are used on critical functions, the contract still makes external calls to `strategy` functions like `withdraw()`, `earn()`, and `withdrawToVault()`. If the strategy is compromised or unexpectedly calls back into the vault (directly or indirectly), it could cause unpredictable results. The `ReentrancyGuard` reduces this risk, but it does not eliminate malicious logic within the strategy itself.

### 7. Potential Token Compatibility Issues

- **Non-standard ERC20 tokens:**  
  The contract assumes `IERC20Upgradeable` tokens behave as expected. If a non-standard ERC20 token (for example, one without `return true` on transfers, or one that reverts unexpectedly) is used, `SafeERC20Upgradeable` should handle it gracefully. Still, relying on correct token behavior is a risk if non-conforming tokens are introduced.

---

### Summary

**Key Vulnerabilities and Risks:**

1. **External Contract Trust:** Heavily relies on external `strategy`, `guestList`, and `vesting` contracts. Vulnerabilities or malicious code in these dependencies compromise user funds.

2. **Governance & Strategist Powers:** They can set high fees within allowed caps and even withdraw or redirect funds. This is a trust rather than a technical vulnerability.

3. **Initialization and Deployment Safety:** `initialize()` must be called promptly and correctly at deployment to prevent takeover.

4. **Complex Fee and Share Calculations:** Potential edge cases when `balance()` is low or zero could cause unintended share distributions.

5. **Pausing Mechanism Confusion:** Two different pause mechanisms could cause unexpected states or actions during emergency scenarios.

None of these issues appear as direct “bugs” in arithmetic or logic that would lead to immediate exploitation by arbitrary attackers without control of external dependencies or privileged roles. Instead, the main concerns revolve around trust assumptions, complexity in fee/pausing logic, and heavy reliance on external contracts and privileged roles.","---

### **Analysis of Issues and Responses**

---

#### **[H-01] StakedCitadel doesn't use correct balance for internal accounting**

**Report Description**:  
The `balance()` function in the `StakedCitadel` contract only returns the vault's balance, omitting the balance of the strategy. This leads to incorrect internal accounting, as the majority of funds are typically held in the strategy. This miscalculation affects the minting and burning of shares during deposits and withdrawals, potentially leading to incorrect share allocations and financial discrepancies.

**Match in Response List**:  
Partially matches with **""4. Fee and Share Calculation Risks""** in the response list. The response mentions potential issues with the `balance()` function and its impact on share calculations, particularly when the balance is unexpectedly low or manipulated.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**.  
The response identifies risks related to the `balance()` function and its role in share calculations. However, it does not explicitly address the issue of the `balance()` function omitting the strategy's balance, which is the core problem in this case. The response focuses on edge cases like low balances but does not propose a solution to include the strategy's balance in the calculation.

**Suggestions**:  
- The response should explicitly recommend modifying the `balance()` function to include the strategy's balance.  
- A detailed explanation of how this change would resolve the issue and ensure accurate share calculations should be provided.

---

#### **[H-02] StakedCitadel: wrong setupVesting function name**

**Report Description**:  
The `_withdraw` function in the `StakedCitadel` contract calls a `setupVesting` function on the vesting contract. However, the actual function name in the `StakedCitadelVester` contract is `vest`. This mismatch causes the `_withdraw` function to fail, preventing users from withdrawing their tokens.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found.**

**Validation**:  
**Unaddressed**.  
The response list does not mention this issue. This is a critical bug that directly impacts the functionality of the `_withdraw` function, making it impossible for users to withdraw their funds. It should have been explicitly addressed in the response list.

**Suggestions**:  
- The response should acknowledge the function name mismatch and recommend renaming the function in either the `StakedCitadel` or `StakedCitadelVester` contract to ensure consistency.  
- Testing should be conducted to verify that the `_withdraw` function works as intended after the fix.

---

#### **[H-03] StakedCitadel depositors can be attacked by the first depositor with depressing of vault token denomination**

**Report Description**:  
The `deposit()` function allows the first depositor to manipulate the vault token denomination by depositing a very small amount. This results in subsequent depositors receiving zero vault tokens for their deposits, effectively stealing their funds. The issue arises because there is no minimum deposit amount enforced, and the share minting logic does not account for this edge case.

**Match in Response List**:  
Partially matches with **""4. Fee and Share Calculation Risks""** in the response list. The response discusses potential issues with share calculations, particularly when the balance is low, but does not explicitly address the attack vector involving the first depositor.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**.  
The response touches on the risks of low balances affecting share calculations but does not explicitly identify the attack vector where the first depositor can exploit the lack of a minimum deposit amount. It also does not propose a solution to mitigate this specific attack.

**Suggestions**:  
- The response should explicitly address the attack vector and recommend implementing a minimum deposit amount to prevent the first depositor from manipulating the vault token denomination.  
- Additional safeguards, such as initializing the vault with a non-zero balance or using a more robust share minting formula, should be considered.

### **GPT-Generated Potential Issues (May Be Incorrect)**

#### **[R-01] Reliance on External Contracts and Trust Model**

**Response Description**:  
The response highlights the risks of relying on external contracts like `IStrategy`, `IBadgerGuestlist`, and `IVesting`. If these contracts are malicious or faulty, they could compromise user funds or disrupt the contract's functionality.

**Assessment**:  
**Valid Concern**.  
While this issue is not explicitly mentioned in the original `issue` report, it is a valid concern. The reliance on external contracts introduces trust assumptions that could be exploited if these contracts are compromised. This is particularly relevant for the `StakedCitadel` contract, which interacts with external strategy and vesting contracts.

---

#### **[R-02] Governance and Strategist Privilege Risks**

**Response Description**:  
The response discusses the risks associated with governance and strategist roles, including the ability to set high fees within allowed caps and sweep tokens. These powers could be misused, leading to a ""governance rug pull"" scenario.

**Assessment**:  
**Valid Concern**.  
This issue is not mentioned in the original `issue` report but is a valid concern. The centralization of power in governance and strategist roles poses a significant trust risk, especially if these roles are not held by trusted parties or if the contract lacks sufficient checks and balances.

---

#### **[R-03] Initialization Concerns**

**Response Description**:  
The response highlights the risks associated with the `initialize()` function, which must be called promptly and correctly during deployment to prevent initialization hijacking.

**Assessment**:  
**Valid Concern**.  
This issue is not mentioned in the original `issue` report but is a valid concern. Proper deployment practices are critical to ensuring the security of upgradeable contracts.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

#### **Correct Matches**:
- None.

#### **Partially Correct Matches**:
- **[H-01] StakedCitadel doesn't use correct balance for internal accounting**: Partially addressed under ""4. Fee and Share Calculation Risks.""

}",2553.0,0,1,"Spotting issues
This solidity contract has a bug in getAmountOut, where if the discount is zero, citadelAmount_ remains uninitialized since local variables default to zero.
Understanding discount impact
If the discount is zero, citadelAmount_ remains zero, which is alarming. This likely indicates an error as the contract likely intended for no discount to apply directly.
Examining discount limits
If funding.discount nears MAX_BPS, it could cause massive token amounts or division by zero. There’s a check if discount < MAX_BPS, safeguarding against excessive amounts.
Evaluating token dynamics
The code’s handling of tokens without decimals() or tokens with malicious behaviors could disrupt operations. Safety measures like transferFrom adherence and reentrancy protections from IVault are essential.
Addressing reentrancy risks
The code manages reentrancy during deposit() with nonReentrant. Trust in xCitadel is paramount to safeguard against malicious reentrancy. citadelPriceInAssetOracle constraints mitigate freezing.
Addressing vulnerabilities
Infinite allowances for xCitadel and citadel might allow malicious actions. Incorrect role assignments could lead to access control breaches. Lack of handling for getAmountOut() when discount is zero.
Identifying the issue
The code fails to handle scenarios where the discount is zero, leading to a potential financial drain where the buyer receives no tokens for their assetAmountIn. This needs urgent attention.
Ensuring fair governance
minDiscount and maxDiscount are set by CONTRACT_GOVERNANCE_ROLE with a check to prevent maxDiscount reaching MAX_BPS. They are verified against minDiscount <= maxDiscount constraints.
Spotting vulnerabilities
	A logic flaw in getAmountOut() where citadelAmount_ remains zero if the discount is zero.
	Lack of constraints on citadelPriceInAsset, potentially leading to price manipulation or overflow in older Solidity versions.
Assessing vulnerabilities
	Logic issue: citadelAmount_ remains zero if the discount is zero.
	Oracle reliance: An untrusted IMedianOracle can disrupt logic.
	Infinite approvals: xCitadel might drain tokens if compromised, though it’s typically trusted.
Evaluating token precision
The use of asset.decimals() can lead to mathematical errors if the token's decimal handling is improper. It's a risk, not a strict vulnerability, but still noteworthy.
","Below are the main vulnerabilities and issues present in the given Solidity contract. These range from critical logic errors to trust assumptions and potential misconfiguration risks.

### 1. Logic Error in `getAmountOut()` Calculation (Zero Discount Case)
**Location:** `getAmountOut()` function

**Issue:**  
When `funding.discount == 0`, the function fails to properly compute `citadelAmount_`. It first calculates `citadelAmountWithoutDiscount` but never uses it directly when the discount is zero. The code snippet:
```solidity
uint256 citadelAmountWithoutDiscount = _assetAmountIn * citadelPriceInAsset;

if (funding.discount > 0) {
    citadelAmount_ = (citadelAmountWithoutDiscount * MAX_BPS) / (MAX_BPS - funding.discount);
}

citadelAmount_ = citadelAmount_ / assetDecimalsNormalizationValue;
```

- If `discount == 0`, the `if` block never executes, leaving `citadelAmount_` at its default of 0. After dividing by `assetDecimalsNormalizationValue`, it remains 0.
- This means buyers would receive no tokens for their deposit if the discount is zero—a severe logical flaw.

**Impact:**  
At a zero discount scenario, investors could pay but receive no tokens, essentially being cheated out of their funds. This is a critical bug and likely not the intended behavior.

**Recommendation:**  
Correct the logic so that if `discount == 0`, `citadelAmount_ = citadelAmountWithoutDiscount / assetDecimalsNormalizationValue`. For example:
```solidity
uint256 citadelAmountWithoutDiscount = _assetAmountIn * citadelPriceInAsset;

if (funding.discount > 0) {
    citadelAmount_ = (citadelAmountWithoutDiscount * MAX_BPS) / (MAX_BPS - funding.discount);
} else {
    citadelAmount_ = citadelAmountWithoutDiscount;
}

citadelAmount_ = citadelAmount_ / assetDecimalsNormalizationValue;
```

### 2. Reliance on External Oracle without Additional Validation
**Location:** `updateCitadelPriceInAsset()` functions

**Issue:**  
The contract trusts the external `IMedianOracle` to provide a valid `citadelPriceInAsset`. While it does ensure the fetched price is nonzero and valid, a compromised or manipulated oracle could still feed incorrect price data.

**Impact:**  
A malicious oracle could trigger `citadelPriceFlag` repeatedly or return extreme values to break the logic of pricing, causing disruption or forcing manual intervention.

**Recommendation:**  
Consider adding fail-safes, time-weighted averages, multiple oracles, or governance-controlled manual overrides to mitigate oracle manipulation risks.

### 3. Unchecked Assumptions About ERC20 `decimals()`
**Location:** During initialization and math operations involving `asset.decimals()`

**Issue:**  
The contract assumes that `asset.decimals()` is implemented and returns a conventional value. Not all ERC20 tokens implement `decimals()` or may return unexpected values (e.g., malicious tokens).

**Impact:**  
If `decimals()` is not standard or returns something extremely large, it could break math logic, causing incorrect token amounts or reverting operations.

**Recommendation:**  
- Validate `asset.decimals()` upon initialization.
- Consider handling unexpected decimals gracefully or using a trusted token contract.

### 4. Potential Infinite Approval Risks
**Location:** In the `initialize` function:
```solidity
IERC20(_citadel).safeApprove(address(_xCitadel), type(uint256).max);
```

**Issue:**  
The contract grants an unlimited approval for `citadel` tokens to the `xCitadel` vault. If `xCitadel` were compromised or replaced, it could drain the contract of all `citadel` tokens.

**Impact:**  
A compromised or malicious `xCitadel` contract could result in loss of funds.

**Recommendation:**  
- Use a tighter allowance model, approving only as much as needed, or rely on trusted code and environment assumptions.
- Continuously audit and ensure that `xCitadel` is a trusted contract.

### 5. Missing Validation in Discount Configuration
**Location:** `setDiscountLimits()` function

**Issue:**  
Although there is a check `require(_maxDiscount < MAX_BPS)`, there is no explicit check that `_minDiscount <= _maxDiscount`. If a higher `minDiscount` than `maxDiscount` is accidentally set, future updates to `discount` may always fail.

**Impact:**  
While not a direct security vulnerability, misconfiguration could break the discount setting logic and cause downtime or inability to set a proper discount.

**Recommendation:**  
Add a check to ensure `_minDiscount <= _maxDiscount`:
```solidity
require(_minDiscount <= _maxDiscount, ""minDiscount must be <= maxDiscount"");
```

### 6. Trust Assumptions in External Calls
**Location:** Calls to external contracts such as `xCitadel.depositFor()`

**Issue:**  
Though the contract uses `ReentrancyGuard`, it still relies on the external `xCitadel` contract to behave as expected. If `xCitadel` is malicious, it could attempt to reenter (though blocked by `nonReentrant`), revert unexpectedly, or cause other logic issues.

**Impact:**  
If `xCitadel` or other external calls are not trusted, it could lead to unexpected behavior or deadlocks.

**Recommendation:**  
Ensure `xCitadel` and any external integrations are trusted and audited. If not, consider additional safety checks.

---

### Summary of Key Vulnerabilities

- **Critical/Logic Bug:** Zero-discount scenario returns zero tokens (`getAmountOut()`).
- **Oracle Trust Risk:** Relying on external `IMedianOracle` without additional safeguards.
- **Token Standard Assumption:** Unverified behavior of `asset.decimals()`.
- **Infinite Approval Risk:** Unlimited token allowance to `xCitadel`.
- **Configuration Issues:** No check that `minDiscount <= maxDiscount`.

Addressing these vulnerabilities and issues will greatly improve the security and reliability of the contract.","---

### **Analysis of Alignment Between `issue` and `response_list`**

---

#### **[M-02] Funding.deposit() doesn't work if there is no discount set**

**Report Description**:  
The `deposit()` function in the `Funding` contract fails when no discount is set. The `getAmountOut()` function returns `0` in this case, causing the `deposit()` function to attempt depositing `0` tokens into the `StakedCitadel` contract. Since the `StakedCitadel` contract requires the token amount to be non-zero, the transaction reverts. This is a critical logical error that prevents the `deposit()` function from working as intended when no discount is configured.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with **""Logic Error in `getAmountOut()` Calculation (Zero Discount Case)""** in the `response_list`.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**.  
The response in the `response_list` accurately identifies the root cause of the issue in the `getAmountOut()` function.

```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)**, we follow these steps:

1. **Identify the ranks of the true positives** in the ranked list of predictions.
2. **Calculate the precision at each rank** where a true positive appears.
3. **Average the precision values** to compute the **Average Precision (AP)**.

### Step 1: Identify the ranks of the true positives
The true positives are:
1. Logic Error in `getAmountOut()` Calculation (Zero Discount Case)
2. Reliance on External Oracle without Additional Validation
3. Unchecked Assumptions About ERC20 `decimals()`
4. Potential Infinite Approval Risks
5. Missing Validation in Discount Configuration
6. Trust Assumptions in External Calls

These true positives appear at ranks **1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6** respectively in the ranked list of predictions.

### Step 2: Calculate the precision at each rank
- **Rank 1**: Precision \( P@1 = \frac{1}{1} = 1.0 \)
- **Rank 2**: Precision \( P@2 = \frac{2}{2} = 1.0 \)
- **Rank 3**: Precision \( P@3 = \frac{3}{3} = 1.0 \)
- **Rank 4**: Precision \( P@4 = \frac{4}{4} = 1.0 \)
- **Rank 5**: Precision \( P@5 = \frac{5}{5} = 1.0 \)
- **Rank 6**: Precision \( P@6 = \frac{6}{6} = 1.0 \)

### Step 3: Average the precision values
\[
AP = \frac{1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0}{6} = 1.0
