}",2175,305,"[H-01] Wrong fee calculation after totalSupply was 0

Submitted by kenzo
handleFees does not update lastFee if startSupply == 0. This means that wrongly, extra fee tokens would be minted once the basket is resupplied and handleFees is called again.
Impact

Loss of user funds. The extra minting of fee tokens comes on the expense of the regular basket token owners, which upon withdrawal would get less underlying than their true share, due to the dilution of their tokens' value.

[M-01] Missing cap on LicenseFee

There is no cap on `LicenseFee`. While change of LicenseFee is under 1 day timelock, introducing a maxLicenseFee can improve credibility by removing the ""rug"" vector. There is a minLicenseFee in the contracts, while imo make little sense to have minLicenseFee but not maxLicenseFee.
An incorrectly set LicenseFee can potentially lead to over/underflow in Basket.sol#L140-141 which is used in most of the function.
  [M-02] Publisher can lock all user funds in the Basket in order to force a user to have their bond burned

Submitted by TomFrenchBlockchain, also found by WatchPug
All user funds in a basket being held hostage by the publisher
Proof of Concept

The Basket publisher can propose an auction in order to set new tokens and weights with a 1 day timelock.
Basket.sol#L216-L244
As part of this call they can set the minIbRatio variable which determines what the maximum slippage on the auction is allowed to be. If it's set to the current IbRatio then the Basket accepts no slippage.
The publisher can choose to set minIbRatio = type(uint256).max which will prevent any auction bids from being successful, locking the basket in the auction state.
It's not possible to enter or exit the basket while an auction is going on, so any users who hold any funds in the basket are forced to take the only option to kill the auction available to them.
  [M-03] Basket.sol#auctionBurn calculates ibRatio wrong

Submitted by 0x0x0x
The function is implemented as follows:
function auctionBurn(uint256 amount) onlyAuction nonReentrant external override {
        uint256 startSupply = totalSupply();
        handleFees(startSupply);
        _burn(msg.sender, amount);

        uint256 newIbRatio = ibRatio * startSupply / (startSupply - amount);
        ibRatio = newIbRatio;

        emit NewIBRatio(newIbRatio);
        emit Burned(msg.sender, amount);
    }

When handleFees is called, totalSupply and ibRatio changes accordingly, but for newIbRatio calculation tokens minted in handleFees is not included. Therefore, ibRatio is calculated higher than it should be. This is dangerous, since last withdrawing user(s) lose their funds with this operation. In case this miscalculation happens more than once, newIbRatio will increase the miscalculation even faster and can result in serious amount of funds missing. At each time auctionBurn is called, at least 1 day (auction duration) of fees result in this miscalculation. Furthermore, all critical logic of this contract is based on ibRatio, this behaviour can create serious miscalculations.
 [M-04] Reentrancy vulnerability in Basket contract's initialize() method.

Submitted by broccolirob
A malicious ""publisher"" can create a basket proposal that mixes real ERC20 tokens with a malicious ERC20 token containing a reentrancy callback in it's approve() method. When the initialize() method is called on the newly cloned Basket contract, a method called approveUnderlying(address(auction)) is called, which would trigger the reentrancy, call initialize() again, passing in altered critical values such as auction and factory, and then removes its self from proposal.tokens and proposal.weights so it doesn't appear in the token list to basket users.
Basket.sol#L44-L61
Impact

Auction and Factory can be set to custom implementations that do malicious things. Since all baskets and auctions are clones with their own addresses, this fact would be difficult for users to detect. Auction controls ibRatio, which a malicious version could send back a manipulated value to Basket, allowing the malicious ""publisher"" to burn basket tokens till all users underlying tokens are drained.

[M-08] Lost fees due to precision loss in fees calculation

Submitted by kenzo, also found by 0v3rf10w
In fees calculation, division is being used in the midst of the calculation, not at the end of it. This leads to lost precision in fee amount (as solidity doesn't save remainder of division). Division should happen at the end to maintain precision.
Impact

Lost fees. The exact amount depends on the parameters set and being tested. According to a few tests I ran, it seems that in normal usage, 1% of fees are lost. In some cases even 7.5% of fees.
Proof of Concept

Division in the midst of a calculation:
uint256 feePct = timeDiff * licenseFee / ONE_YEAR;
uint256 fee = startSupply * feePct / (BASE - feePct);

_mint(publisher, fee * (BASE - factory.ownerSplit()) / BASE);
_mint(Ownable(address(factory)).owner(), fee * factory.ownerSplit() / BASE);
  [M-09] Basket:handleFees fee calculation is wrong

Submitted by GiveMeTestEther
The fee calculation on L141 is wrong. It should only get divided by BASE and not (BASE - feePct)
Proof of Concept

This shows dividing only by BASE is correct: Assumptions:
BASE is 1e18 accordign to the code
timeDiff is exactly ONE_YEAR (for easier calculations)
startSupply is 1e18 (exactly one basket token, also represents 100% in fee terms)
licenseFee is 1e15 (0.1%)
If we calculate the fee of one whole year and startSupply is one token (1e18, equal to 100%), the fee should be exactly the licenseFee (1e15, 0.1%),
 [M-10] Fee calculation is slightly off

Submitted by gzeon
The fee calculation
uint256 timeDiff = (block.timestamp - lastFee);
uint256 feePct = timeDiff * licenseFee / ONE_YEAR;
uint256 fee = startSupply * feePct / (BASE - feePct);

tries to calculate a fee such that fee/(supply+fee) = %fee using a simple interest formula (i.e. no compounding), this lead to slightly less fee collected when fee are collected more frequently (small timeDiff) vs less frequently (big timeDiff).

}

Key observations and rationale:

1. The task list covers multiple critical audit areas, focusing on security, economic integrity, and potential attack vectors.

2. Special attention is given to:
   - The complex fee and ibRatio mechanisms
   - Governance and timelock processes
   - External contract interactions
   - Potential economic manipulations

3. Each task is designed to probe specific potential vulnerabilities identified in the initial code analysis.

4. The tasks provide a structured approach to thoroughly examining the Basket contract's security and functionality.

Recommendations for the audit:
- Use comprehensive test cases for each task
- Employ formal verification techniques where possible
- Consider both technical security and economic security aspects
- Validate assumptions about external contract behaviors

The audit should aim to ensure the contract is secure, economically sound, and resistant to potential exploit vectors.","Looking at the provided smart contract, I'll analyze it in detail following the requested format:

      ""Issue"": ""Lack of validation for token duplicates in validateWeights function"",
      ""Severity"": ""High"",
      ""Description"": ""The validateWeights function has a flawed implementation for checking token uniqueness. It creates an array 'tokenList' and attempts to check if each token is already in the list, but it incorrectly checks the entire pre-allocated array (including uninitialized elements with zero addresses) instead of only checking previously added tokens. This means the duplicate check doesn't work as intended."",
      ""Impact"": ""This allows duplicate tokens to be included in the basket, which could lead to accounting errors, unexpected behavior, and potential manipulation of the basket's value. The validation could also incorrectly reject valid token lists due to comparing with uninitialized array values, breaking core functionality."",

      ""Issue"": ""Reentrancy vulnerability in the handleFees function"",
      ""Severity"": ""High"",
      ""Description"": ""While the mint and burn functions have nonReentrant modifiers, the internal handleFees function makes external calls to the factory owner without protection. If the factory owner is a malicious contract, it could reenter the Basket contract during token minting. The function mints tokens before updating the ibRatio, which could lead to inconsistent state."",

}",430.3425581455231,64318.0,34.0,"### **[H-01] Wrong fee calculation after totalSupply was 0**

**Report Description**:
The `handleFees` function does not update `lastFee` if `startSupply == 0`. This means that extra fee tokens would be minted once the basket is resupplied and `handleFees` is called again. This leads to a loss of user funds, as the extra minting of fee tokens dilutes the value of regular basket tokens, causing users to receive less underlying than their true share upon withdrawal.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the specific issue of incorrect fee calculation when `totalSupply` is 0. This is a critical oversight, as it directly impacts user funds and the integrity of the fee mechanism.

---

### **[M-01] Missing cap on LicenseFee**

**Report Description**:
There is no cap on `LicenseFee`. While changes to `LicenseFee` are under a 1-day timelock, introducing a `maxLicenseFee` can improve credibility by removing the ""rug"" vector. An incorrectly set `LicenseFee` can potentially lead to over/underflow in `Basket.sol#L140-141`, which is used in most functions.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of missing a cap on `LicenseFee`. This is a significant oversight, as it leaves the contract vulnerable to economic manipulation and potential arithmetic errors.

---

### **[M-02] Publisher can lock all user funds in the Basket in order to force a user to have their bond burned**

**Report Description**:
The `Basket` publisher can propose an auction to set new tokens and weights with a 1-day timelock. By setting `minIbRatio` to `type(uint256).max`, the publisher can prevent any auction bids from being successful, locking the basket in the auction state. This prevents users from entering or exiting the basket, forcing them to take the only option to kill the auction available to them.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Centralization risk with privileged publisher role""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the centralization risk associated with the publisher role but does not specifically address the issue of locking user funds by manipulating `minIbRatio`. The impact of this specific vulnerability is not fully covered.

---

### **[M-03] Basket.sol#auctionBurn calculates ibRatio wrong**

**Report Description**:
The `auctionBurn` function calculates `ibRatio` incorrectly by not accounting for tokens minted in `handleFees`. This leads to `ibRatio` being calculated higher than it should be, which can result in the last withdrawing user(s) losing their funds. Repeated occurrences of this miscalculation can lead to significant fund losses.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Unchecked IBRatio Manipulation""**.

**Validation**:
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue with `ibRatio` manipulation and the potential for arithmetic overflow. It correctly explains the risks associated with incorrect `ibRatio` calculations, which aligns with the reported issue.

---

### **[M-04] Reentrancy vulnerability in Basket contract's initialize() method**

**Report Description**:
A malicious ""publisher"" can create a basket proposal that mixes real ERC20 tokens with a malicious ERC20 token containing a reentrancy callback in its `approve()` method. When `initialize()` is called on the newly cloned `Basket` contract, the reentrancy callback can alter critical values such as `auction` and `factory`, potentially allowing the malicious publisher to drain user funds.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Reentrancy vulnerability in the handleFees function""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies a reentrancy vulnerability but focuses on the `handleFees` function rather than the `initialize()` method. The specific issue of reentrancy during initialization is not fully addressed.

---

### **[M-08] Lost fees due to precision loss in fees calculation**

**Report Description**:
In the fee calculation, division is used in the midst of the calculation rather than at the end, leading to lost precision in the fee amount. This results in lost fees, with tests showing losses of up to 7.5% in some cases.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Fee Calculation Precision Loss""**.

**Validation**:
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue of precision loss in fee calculations. It correctly explains the risks associated with incorrect fee calculations, which aligns with the reported issue.

---

### **[M-09] Basket:handleFees fee calculation is wrong**

**Report Description**:
The fee calculation in `handleFees` is incorrect. The fee should only be divided by `BASE` and not `(BASE - feePct)`. This leads to incorrect fee amounts being calculated, which can result in economic imbalances.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the specific issue of incorrect fee calculation in `handleFees`. This is a significant oversight, as it directly impacts the economic model of the contract.

---

### **[M-10] Fee calculation is slightly off**

**Report Description**:
The fee calculation uses a simple interest formula, leading to slightly less fee collected when fees are collected more frequently versus less frequently. This results in a discrepancy in fee amounts based on the frequency of fee collection.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Fee Calculation Precision Loss""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the issue of precision loss in fee calculations but does not specifically address the discrepancy based on the frequency of fee collection. The impact of this specific vulnerability is not fully covered.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:

- **[M-03] Basket.sol#auctionBurn calculates ibRatio wrong**
- **[M-08] Lost fees due to precision loss in fees calculation**

**Partially Correct Matches**:

- **[M-02] Publisher can lock all user funds in the Basket in order to force a user to have their bond burned**
- **[M-04] Reentrancy vulnerability in Basket contract's initialize() method**
- **[M-10] Fee calculation is slightly off**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:

- **[H-01] Wrong fee calculation after totalSupply was 0**

}

The Factory contract implements a mechanism to create and manage basket tokens, which appear to be tokens representing a basket of other tokens at predefined weights. The contract uses the minimal proxy pattern (EIP-1167) through OpenZeppelin's Clones library to deploy new basket and auction contracts efficiently.

Some potential security considerations:
1. The contract uses ReentrancyGuard for the createBasket function, which is good practice.
2. The owner has significant control through various setter functions.
3. The maximum owner split is capped at 20% (2e17), providing some protection against excessive fees.
4. The contract validates token weights through the basketImpl.validateWeights call.
5. The contract uses SafeERC20 for token transfers, protecting against failed transfers.","I'll analyze and consolidate the different sets of issues from the Factory.sol contract analysis.

**Report Description**:
The issue highlights that the factory can change the `auctionMultiplier` and `auctionDecrement` parameters, which directly affect the profitability of bonded auctions. There is no protection against this behavior, and factory owners can exploit this to steal all tokens from baskets where they are bonded for the auction. This creates a significant risk of centralization and potential abuse by the factory owner.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Centralized Control of Critical Parameters""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response correctly identifies the centralized control of critical parameters, including `auctionMultiplier` and `auctionDecrement`, and acknowledges the risk of owner manipulation. However, it does not explicitly address the specific risk of the factory owner stealing tokens from baskets by abusing these parameters. The response focuses more on the general risks of centralized control rather than the specific exploit described in the issue. Therefore, while the response is relevant, it misses critical details about the potential for token theft.

### **Analysis of Gaps**
The response list covers the general issue of centralized control of critical parameters but does not delve into the specific exploit where the factory owner can steal tokens from baskets by manipulating `auctionMultiplier` and `auctionDecrement`. This gap indicates a need for more detailed analysis of the potential consequences of centralized control, particularly in scenarios where it can lead to direct financial loss or exploitation.","```

",1190,163,"[M-06] Basket can be fully drained if the auction is settled within a specific block

Submitted by Ruhum
The `settleAuction()` function allows someone to settle the auction by transferring funds in a way that the new pending index is fulfilled. As a reward, they are able to take out as many tokens as they want as long as the pending index is fulfilled after that. The function verifies that the basket has received everything it wanted using the following logic:
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < pendingWeights.length; i++) {
      uint256 tokensNeeded = basketAsERC20.totalSupply() * pendingWeights[i] * newRatio / BASE / BASE;
      require(IERC20(pendingTokens[i]).balanceOf(address(basket)) >= tokensNeeded);
  }

The attack vector here is to manipulate tokensNeeded to be 0. That way we can drain the basket completely without the function reverting.
For that, we manipulate newRatio to be 0 then the whole thing will be 0. newRatio is defined as:
  uint256 a = factory.auctionMultiplier() * basket.ibRatio();
  uint256 b = (bondBlock - auctionStart) * BASE / factory.auctionDecrement();
  uint256 newRatio = a - b;

There's 1 value the attacker controls, bondBlock. That value is the block in which the bondForRebalance() function was triggered. So the goal is to get newRatio to be 0. With the base settings of the contract:
  [M-07] Auction.sol#settleAuction() Bonder may not be able to settle a bonded auction, leading to loss of funds

Submitted by WatchPug
Auction.sol#L97-L102
    uint256 a = factory.auctionMultiplier() * basket.ibRatio();
    uint256 b = (bondBlock - auctionStart) * BASE / factory.auctionDecrement();
    uint256 newRatio = a - b;

    (address[] memory pendingTokens, uint256[] memory pendingWeights, uint256 minIbRatio) = basket.getPendingWeights();
    require(newRatio >= minIbRatio);

In the current implementation, newRatio is calculated and compared with minIbRatio in settleAuction().
However, if newRatio is less than minIbRatio, settleAuction() will always fail and there is no way for the bonder to cancel and get a refund.

Key Observations and Recommendations:

1. The contract has several security-conscious design choices:
   - Uses SafeERC20 for token transfers
   - Implements ReentrancyGuard
   - Has time and block-based constraints
   - Uses modifiers for access control

2. Potential areas of concern:
   - Complex ratio calculation logic
   - Multiple external contract interactions
   - Time-sensitive auction mechanisms

3. Recommended additional steps:
   - Conduct thorough unit testing
   - Perform formal verification of mathematical calculations
   - Consider professional smart contract auditing services

After reviewing this contract, I would note that it appears to be a component of a larger DeFi system focused on managed token baskets. The auction mechanism allows for controlled rebalancing of the token composition while ensuring proper incentives through the bonding system. The bounty mechanism provides additional rewards for participating in successful auctions. The contract includes safety features like reentrancy protection and proper access controls through modifiers.","I've analyzed the input data containing multiple security reviews of the `Auction.sol` contract.

}",365.66173911094666,49244.0,32.0,"### **[M-06] Basket can be fully drained if the auction is settled within a specific block**

**Report Description**:
The `settleAuction()` function allows an attacker to settle the auction by manipulating the `newRatio` value to 0. This is achieved by controlling the `bondBlock` value, which is the block in which the `bondForRebalance()` function was triggered. When `newRatio` is 0, the `tokensNeeded` calculation results in 0, allowing the attacker to drain the basket completely without the function reverting. This vulnerability arises from the lack of validation on the `newRatio` value and its impact on the `tokensNeeded` calculation.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the specific issue of manipulating `newRatio` to 0, which allows the basket to be drained. While the response list mentions potential arithmetic issues in calculations, it does not cover the critical vulnerability of `newRatio` being manipulated to 0, leading to a complete drain of the basket.

---

### **[M-07] Auction.sol#settleAuction() Bonder may not be able to settle a bonded auction, leading to loss of funds**

**Report Description**:
The `settleAuction()` function calculates `newRatio` and compares it with `minIbRatio`. If `newRatio` is less than `minIbRatio`, the function will always fail, and there is no mechanism for the bonder to cancel and get a refund. This can lead to a loss of funds for the bonder, as they are unable to settle the auction or recover their bond.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of bonders being unable to settle auctions or recover their bonds when `newRatio` is less than `minIbRatio`. While the response list mentions insufficient validation in the `settleAuction` function, it does not cover the specific risk of bonders losing funds due to the inability to settle or cancel the auction.

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:
- **[M-06] Basket can be fully drained if the auction is settled within a specific block**
- **[M-07] Auction.sol#settleAuction() Bonder may not be able to settle a bonded auction, leading to loss of funds**

### **Conclusion**
The response list does not adequately address the specific vulnerabilities identified in the issue report. Both [M-06] and [M-07] highlight critical risks related to the `settleAuction()` function, but these issues are not covered in the response list. The response list focuses on other potential vulnerabilities but misses these key concerns, leading to a significant gap in the security analysis.","```
