MasterChef.sol#L86
When adding new token pool for staking in MasterChef contract ```
function add(address _token, uint _allocationPoints, uint16 _depositFee, uint _startBlock)
```
All other, already added, pools should be updated but currently they are not. Instead, only totalPoints is updated. Therefore, old (and not updated) pools will lose it's share during the next update. Therefore, user rewards are not computed correctly (will be always smaller).
  [H-02] Masterchef: Improper handling of deposit fee

Submitted by hickuphh3, also found by leastwood
MasterChef.sol#L170-L172
If a pool’s deposit fee is non-zero, it is subtracted from the amount to be credited to the user.
``` if (pool.depositFeeBP > 0) {
  uint depositFee = _amount.mul(pool.depositFeeBP).div(_perMille);
  user.amount = SafeCast.toUint128(user.amount + _amount - depositFee);
}
```
However, the deposit fee is not credited to anyone, leading to permanent lockups of deposit fees in the relevant depositor contracts (StakingRewards and ConvexStakingWrapper for now).

 [H-08] MasterChef.sol Users won't be able to receive the concur rewards

Submitted by WatchPug, also found by hickuphh3 and leastwood
According to:
README
Implementation of deposit(): /contracts/MasterChef.sol#L157-L180
MasterChef is only recording the deposited amount in the states, it's not actually holding the depositToken.
depositToken won't be transferred from _msgSender() to the MasterChef contract.
Therefore, in updatePool() L140 lpSupply = pool.depositToken.balanceOf(address(this)) will always be 0. And the updatePool() will be returned at L147.
  [H-09] deposit in ConvexStakingWrapper will most certainly revert

Submitted by wuwe1, also found by WatchPug
ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L94-L99

            pids[IRewardStaking(convexBooster).poolInfo(_pid).lptoken] = _pid;
            convexPool[_pid] = mainPool;

convexPool[_pid] is set to IRewardStaking(convexBooster).poolInfo(_pid).crvRewards;
crvRewards is a BaseRewardPool like this one: https://etherscan.io/address/0x8B55351ea358e5Eda371575B031ee24F462d503e#code.
BaseRewardPool does not implement poolInfo
ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L238
IRewardStaking(convexPool[_pid]).poolInfo(_pid).lptoken

Above line calls poolInfo of crvRewards which causes revert.
  [M-02] Unconstrained fee

Submitted by Czar102, also found by defsec, Dravee, harleythedog, hickuphh3, and throttle
MasterChef.sol#L86-L101
Token fee in MasterChef can be set to more than 100%, (for example, by accident) causing all deposit calls to fail due to underflow on subtraction when reward is lowered by the fee, thus breaking essential mechanics. Note that after the fee has been set to any value, it cannot be undone. A token cannot be removed, added, or added the second time. Thus, mistakenly (or deliberately, maliciously) added fee that is larger than 100% will make the contract impossible to recover from not being able to use the token.
  [M-20] MasterChef.updatePool() Fails To Update Reward Variables If block.number >= endBlock

Submitted by leastwood, also found by CertoraInc, csanuragjain, Czar102, hickuphh3, kirk-baird, and WatchPug
The updatePool function intends to calculate the accumulated Concur rewards by tracking the number of blocks passed since the last update to correctly determine how many Concur tokens to distribute to each share. The reward distribution has a start and end block which dictates the timeframe by which rewards will be distributed to the underlying pool.
If a pool has not recently updated itself and has reached the block.number >= endBlock statement in updatePool, then any rewards that it would normally be entitled to prior to reaching endBlock will not be attributed to the pool. Therefore, once rewards are no longer being distributed, pools who had not recently called updatePool before reaching endBlock are at a disadvantage as compared to more active pools.",6.0,,"pragma solidity =0.8.9;

}

Based on my audit, I've identified several concerns:

1. **Critical Issues**:
   - The check `if (pairData.price1Average._x != 0) { require(sumNative != 0); }` in the `consult()` function appears to be redundant and could cause unnecessary reverts
   - Lack of division by zero checks in several calculations
   - No price manipulation protection for low liquidity pools

2. **Centralization Risks**:
   - Owner-only functions for updating the oracle
   - No timelock or governance mechanism for sensitive operations

3. **Technical Concerns**:
   - Precision loss in several calculations
   - Potential issues with handling different token decimals
   - Lack of events for tracking important state changes

While the core TWAP oracle functionality appears sound, these issues should be addressed before deployment to production to ensure the contract operates correctly and securely.","I've analyzed the input data containing multiple security issue reports for the TwapOracle contract.

#### **[H-01] Wrong reward token calculation in MasterChef contract**

**Report Description**:  
When adding a new token pool for staking in the MasterChef contract, the `add` function updates `totalPoints` but fails to update the allocation points of existing pools. This oversight causes old pools to lose their share during the next update, leading to incorrect user rewards that are always smaller than expected.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The problem involves incorrect reward calculations due to missing updates to existing pools, which is not covered in the response list.

---

#### **[H-02] Masterchef: Improper handling of deposit fee**

**Report Description**:  
If a pool’s deposit fee is non-zero, it is subtracted from the user’s deposited amount but is not credited to anyone. This results in permanent lockups of deposit fees in the relevant depositor contracts, leading to a loss of funds.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The problem involves improper handling of deposit fees, which is not covered in the response list.

---

#### **[H-08] MasterChef.sol Users won't be able to receive the concur rewards**

**Report Description**:  
The `deposit` function in MasterChef records the deposited amount but does not transfer the `depositToken` from the user to the contract. As a result, `lpSupply` in `updatePool` will always be `0`, causing the function to return early and preventing users from receiving rewards.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The problem involves missing token transfers and incorrect reward distribution, which is not covered in the response list.

---

#### **[H-09] deposit in ConvexStakingWrapper will most certainly revert**

**Report Description**:  
The `ConvexStakingWrapper` contract incorrectly assumes that `BaseRewardPool` implements the `poolInfo` function, which it does not. This causes a revert when attempting to call `poolInfo` on `crvRewards`, making the `deposit` function unusable.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The problem involves incorrect assumptions about external contract interfaces, which is not covered in the response list.

---

#### **[M-02] Unconstrained fee**

**Report Description**:  
The `MasterChef` contract allows the deposit fee to be set to more than 100%, causing all `deposit` calls to fail due to underflow. This issue cannot be fixed as tokens cannot be removed or re-added, making the contract permanently unusable for the affected token.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The problem involves unconstrained fee settings and underflow vulnerabilities, which is not covered in the response list.

---

#### **[M-20] MasterChef.updatePool() Fails To Update Reward Variables If block.number >= endBlock**

**Report Description**:  
The `updatePool` function fails to update reward variables if `block.number >= endBlock`. This means pools that have not recently updated before reaching `endBlock` will not receive their entitled rewards, disadvantaging less active pools.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The problem involves incorrect reward distribution logic, which is not covered in the response list.

Shelter.sol#L52-L57
tl;dr Anyone who can call `withdraw` to withdraw their own funds can call it repeatedly to withdraw the funds of others. withdraw should only succeed if the user hasn't withdrawn the token already.
The shelter can be used for users to withdraw funds in the event of an emergency. The withdraw function allows callers to withdraw tokens based on the tokens they have deposited into the shelter client: ConvexStakingWrapper. However, withdraw does not check if a user has already withdrawn their tokens. Thus a user that can withdraw tokens, can call withdraw repeatedly to steal the tokens of others.
  [H-07] Shelter claimed mapping is set with _to address and not msg.sender

Function `withdraw()`, claimed[_token][_to] 
Any user can withdraw all the funds from the shelter. This is done by calling withdraw repeatedly until all funds are drained. You only need to have a small share.
Even if the claimed mapping was checked, there would still be a vulnerability. This is because the claimed mapping is updated with the _to address, not the msg.sender address.
  [M-01] Deposits after the grace period should not be allowed

Submitted by pauliax
Shelter.sol#L34 Shelter.sol#L54
Function donate in Shelter shouldn't allow new deposits after the grace period ends, when the claim period begins. Otherwise, it will be possible to increase savedTokens[_token], and thus new user claim amounts will increase after some users might already have withdrawn their shares.
  [M-07] Fee-on-transfer token donations in Shelter break withdrawals

Submitted by cmichel, also found by Dravee, IllIllI, and Ruhum
Shelter.sol#L34
The Sheler.donate function transferFroms _amount and adds the entire _amount to savedTokens[_token]. But the actual received token amount from the transfer can be less for fee-on-transfer tokens.
The last person to withdraw will not be able to as withdraw uses a share computation for the entire savedTokens[_token] amount. The calculated amount will then be higher than the actual contract balance.
function donate(IERC20 _token, uint256 _amount) external {
    require(activated[_token] != 0, ""!activated"");
    savedTokens[_token] += _amount;
    // @audit fee-on-transfer. then fails for last person in `withdraw`
    _token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
}

function withdraw(IERC20 _token, address _to) external override {
    // @audit percentage on storage var, not on actual balance
    uint256 amount = savedTokens[_token] * client.shareOf(_token, msg.sender) / client.totalShare(_token);
    // @audit amount might not be in contract anymore as savedTokens[_token] is over-reported
    _token.safeTransfer(_to, amount);
}  [M-08] Donated Tokens Cannot Be Recovered If A Shelter Is Deactivated

Submitted by leastwood, also found by reassor
The shelter mechanism can be activated and deactivated on a target LP token. The owner of the ConvexStakingWrapper.sol contract can initiate the shelter whereby LP tokens are sent to the Shelter.sol contract. However, if the owner decides to deactivate the shelter before the grace period has passed, all LP tokens are transferred back to the ConvexStakingWrapper.sol contract. Donated tokens are also sent back to the contract. As a result, these tokens do not actually belong to any user and will effectively be lost in the contract.

    ""The client contract can withdraw all tokens when deactivating regardless of donations made after activation""
  ]
}

After reviewing this contract, I've identified several potential vulnerabilities:

1. **Missing double-withdrawal check**: While the contract tracks claims in the `claimed` mapping, it doesn't actually check this value before allowing withdrawals, making double-withdrawals possible.

2. **Token balance tracking issue**: When activating a shelter, it records the current balance, but doesn't account for potential existing balances from previous activations.

3. **Donation security**: Users can donate to activated shelters, but there's no verification that the grace period hasn't passed yet.

4. **Grace period precision**: The deactivation function checks if the grace period has not fully passed, but this could lead to unexpected behavior at exactly the boundary time.

5. **Centralized control**: The client contract has significant power to activate and deactivate shelters within the grace period, potentially allowing it to manipulate the system.","I've analyzed the various lists of security findings for the Shelter contract. Let me consolidate similar issues and present them in a structured format.

}",312.770612955093,35229.0,32.0,"### **[H-03] Repeated Calls to Shelter.withdraw Can Drain All Funds in Shelter**

**Report Description**:
The `withdraw` function in `Shelter.sol` allows users to withdraw tokens based on their deposited shares. However, it does not check if a user has already withdrawn their tokens. This oversight enables users to call `withdraw` repeatedly, potentially draining all funds from the shelter. Additionally, the `claimed` mapping is updated with the `_to` address instead of `msg.sender`, further exacerbating the issue by allowing users to withdraw funds to different addresses without being detected.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Claimed mapping not checked during withdrawal""**.

**Validation**:
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue with the `claimed` mapping not being checked during withdrawals. It correctly explains the risks associated with users being able to withdraw multiple times, which aligns with the reported vulnerability. The response also highlights the mismatch between the `_to` address and `msg.sender`, which is a critical detail in the issue.

---

### **[H-07] Shelter claimed mapping is set with _to address and not msg.sender**

**Report Description**:
The `withdraw` function updates the `claimed` mapping with the `_to` address instead of `msg.sender`. This allows users to withdraw funds to different addresses without being detected, as the mapping does not track the actual sender. Even if the `claimed` mapping was checked, this design flaw would still allow users to bypass the intended access control mechanism.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Claimed mapping not checked during withdrawal""**.

**Validation**:
**Correct**. The response correctly identifies the issue with the `claimed` mapping being updated with the `_to` address instead of `msg.sender`. This is a critical detail in the reported vulnerability, and the response accurately explains the risks associated with this design flaw.

---

### **[M-01] Deposits after the grace period should not be allowed**

**Report Description**:
The `donate` function in `Shelter.sol` allows new deposits even after the grace period ends, when the claim period begins. This can lead to an increase in `savedTokens[_token]`, which in turn increases the claim amounts for new users. This is problematic because some users may have already withdrawn their shares, leading to discrepancies in token distribution.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Missed Issue**. The response list does not address the issue of allowing deposits after the grace period, which is a significant oversight. This issue could lead to unfair token distribution and should be addressed in the response list.

---

### **[M-07] Fee-on-transfer token donations in Shelter break withdrawals**

**Report Description**:
The `donate` function in `Shelter.sol` adds the entire `_amount` to `savedTokens[_token]` before transferring the tokens. For fee-on-transfer tokens, the actual received amount may be less than `_amount`. This discrepancy can lead to incorrect share calculations in the `withdraw` function, potentially causing the last person to withdraw to fail due to insufficient contract balance.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Missed Issue**. The response list does not address the issue of fee-on-transfer tokens, which is a critical vulnerability. This oversight could lead to incorrect token accounting and failed withdrawals, and should be included in the response list.

---

### **[M-08] Donated Tokens Cannot Be Recovered If A Shelter Is Deactivated**

**Report Description**:
When the shelter is deactivated, all LP tokens, including donated tokens, are transferred back to the `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol` contract. However, these donated tokens do not belong to any user and are effectively lost in the contract. This design flaw prevents the recovery of donated tokens if the shelter is deactivated before the grace period ends.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Missed Issue**. The response list does not address the issue of donated tokens being lost when the shelter is deactivated. This is a significant oversight that could lead to permanent loss of funds, and should be included in the response list.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:

- **[H-03] Repeated Calls to Shelter.withdraw Can Drain All Funds in Shelter**
- **[H-07] Shelter claimed mapping is set with _to address and not msg.sender**

**Partially Correct Matches**:

- *None*

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:

- **[M-01] Deposits after the grace period should not be allowed**
- **[M-07] Fee-on-transfer token donations in Shelter break withdrawals**
- **[M-08] Donated Tokens Cannot Be Recovered If A Shelter Is Deactivated**

---

The response list accurately addresses some of the critical issues, particularly those related to the `claimed` mapping and repeated withdrawals. However, it misses several important vulnerabilities, such as allowing deposits after the grace period, handling fee-on-transfer tokens, and recovering donated tokens upon deactivation. These gaps should be addressed to ensure comprehensive coverage of the reported issues.",3,0,2,11,"```
1. Claimed mapping not checked during withdrawal
```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the rank of the true positive**:
   - The true positive is `""Claimed mapping not checked during withdrawal""`.
   - This issue appears at **rank 1** in the ranked list of predictions.

2. **Calculate the precision at that rank**:
   - Precision at rank 1 (\( P@1 \)) is calculated as the number of true positives up to rank 1 divided by the rank.
   - Since there is 1 true positive at rank 1, \( P@1 = \frac{1}{1} = 1.0 \).

3. **Compute the Average Precision (AP)**:
   - Since there is only one true positive, the AP is simply the precision at the rank where the true positive appears.
   - Therefore, \( AP = 1.0 \).

function `_calcRewardIntegral()`   [H-10] ConvexStakingWrapper.exitShelter() Will Lock LP Tokens, Preventing Users From Withdrawing

Submitted by leastwood
The shelter mechanism provides emergency functionality in an effort to protect users' funds. The enterShelter function will withdraw all LP tokens from the pool, transfer them to the shelter contract and activate the shelter for the target LP token. Conversely, the exitShelter function will deactivate the shelter and transfer all LP tokens back to the ConvexStakingWrapper.sol contract.
Unfortunately, LP tokens aren't restaked in the pool, causing LP tokens to be stuck within the contract. Users will be unable to withdraw their LP tokens as the withdraw function attempts to withdrawAndUnwrap LP tokens from the staking pool. As a result, this function will always revert due to insufficient staked balance. If other users decide to deposit their LP tokens, then these tokens can be swiped by users who have had their LP tokens locked in the contract.
This guarantees poor UX for the protocol and will most definitely lead to LP token loss.
  [H-11] ConvexStakingWrapper._calcRewardIntegral() Can Be Manipulated To Steal Tokens From Other Pools

Submitted by leastwood, also found by cmichel and kirk-baird
The ConvexStakingWrapper.sol implementation makes several modifications to the original design. One of the key changes is the ability to add multiple pools into the wrapper contract, where each pool is represented by a unique _pid. By doing this, we are able to aggregate pools and their LP tokens to simplify the token distribution process.
However, the interdependence between pools introduces new problems. Because the original implementation uses the contract's reward token balance to track newly claimed tokens, it is possible for a malicious user to abuse the unguarded getReward function to maximise the profit they are able to generate. By calling getReward on multiple pools with the same reward token (i.e. cvx), users are able to siphon rewards from other pools. This inevitably leads to certain loss of rewards for users who have deposited LP tokens into these victim pools. As crv and cvx are reward tokens by default, it is very likely that someone will want to exploit this issue.
  [M-11] ConvexStakingWrapper.enterShelter() May Erroneously Overwrite amountInShelter Leading To Locked Tokens

Submitted by leastwood
The shelter mechanism provides emergency functionality in an effort to protect users' funds. The enterShelter function will withdraw all LP tokens from the pool, transfer them to the shelter contract and activate the shelter for the target LP token. If this function is called again on the same LP token, the amountInShelter value is overwritten, potentially by the zero amount. As a result its possible that the shelter is put in a state where no users can withdraw from it or only a select few users with a finite number of shares are able to. Once the shelter has passed its grace period, these tokens may forever be locked in the shelter contract.
Proof of Concept

    for(uint256 i = 0; i<_pids.length; i++){
        IRewardStaking pool = IRewardStaking(convexPool[_pids[i]]);
        uint256 amount = pool.balanceOf(address(this));
        pool.withdrawAndUnwrap(amount, false);
        IERC20 lpToken = IERC20(
            pool.poolInfo(_pids[i]).lptoken
        );
        amountInShelter[lpToken] = amount;
        lpToken.safeTransfer(address(shelter), amount);
        shelter.activate(lpToken);
    }

  [M-14] Owner can steal Concur rewards

Submitted by Czar102
MasterChef.sol#L78-L80 MasterChef.sol#L157-L180
Owner can steal Concur rewards by adding a depositor and inflating other depositors' assigned balance of the token within the contract. Thus, the owner-managed depositor can get most (all but one wei) of the created tokens.
  [M-15] Owner can lock tokens in MasterChef

Submitted by Czar102, also found by csanuragjain and Jujic
MasterChef.sol#L82-L84
Owner can remove a depositor. Since only depositors can deposit and withdraw, the owner may add a contract to the whitelist, let users deposit in the contract and remove the depositor from the whitelist. Depositor's reward cannot be withdrawn then. And takes a share of Concur tokens that will not be distributed.
  [M-16] Rewards get diluted because totalAllocPoint can only increase.

}",1201.10434317589,16204.0,104.0,"### **[H-04] ConvexStakingWrapper, StakingRewards Wrong implementation will send concur rewards to the wrong receiver**

**Report Description**:
The `ConvexStakingWrapper` and `StakingRewards` contracts incorrectly use `masterChef.deposit()` and `masterChef.withdraw()`, which take `_msgSender()` as the user address. However, `_msgSender()` returns the address of `ConvexStakingWrapper` and `StakingRewards` instead of the actual user. This misimplementation causes `concur` rewards to be sent to the wrong receiver, leading to incorrect reward distribution and potential loss of funds for users.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of incorrect reward distribution due to the misuse of `_msgSender()` in `ConvexStakingWrapper` and `StakingRewards`. This is a critical issue that directly impacts reward allocation and user funds, but it is not covered in the response list.

---

### **[H-06] ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#_calcRewardIntegral Wrong implementation can disrupt rewards calculation and distribution**

**Report Description**:
The `_calcRewardIntegral` function in `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol` has a flawed implementation that can disrupt the calculation and distribution of rewards. This could lead to incorrect reward allocations, potentially causing users to receive fewer rewards than they are entitled to or allowing malicious actors to exploit the system.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the specific issue with the `_calcRewardIntegral` function. While it mentions ""Unsafe External Interactions"" and ""Integer Overflow/Underflow Risks,"" these do not directly cover the flawed reward calculation logic in `_calcRewardIntegral`.

---

### **[H-10] ConvexStakingWrapper.exitShelter() Will Lock LP Tokens, Preventing Users From Withdrawing**

**Report Description**:
The `exitShelter` function in `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol` does not restake LP tokens back into the pool after transferring them from the shelter contract. This causes LP tokens to be stuck in the contract, preventing users from withdrawing their funds. If other users deposit LP tokens, they can be swiped by users whose tokens are locked, leading to poor user experience and potential loss of funds.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of LP tokens being locked in the contract due to the flawed implementation of `exitShelter`. This is a critical issue that directly impacts user funds and contract functionality, but it is not covered in the response list.

---

### **[H-11] ConvexStakingWrapper._calcRewardIntegral() Can Be Manipulated To Steal Tokens From Other Pools**

**Report Description**:
The `_calcRewardIntegral` function in `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol` can be manipulated by malicious users to siphon rewards from other pools. By calling `getReward` on multiple pools with the same reward token (e.g., `cvx`), users can maximize their profits at the expense of other users, leading to a loss of rewards for those who deposited LP tokens into the victim pools.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of reward token manipulation in `_calcRewardIntegral`. While it mentions ""Unsafe External Interactions,"" it does not cover the specific vulnerability of reward siphoning across multiple pools.

---

### **[M-11] ConvexStakingWrapper.enterShelter() May Erroneously Overwrite amountInShelter Leading To Locked Tokens**

**Report Description**:
The `enterShelter` function in `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol` overwrites the `amountInShelter` value when called multiple times on the same LP token. This can lead to a state where the shelter is activated with a zero or incorrect amount, potentially locking tokens in the shelter contract and preventing users from withdrawing their funds.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of `amountInShelter` being overwritten in `enterShelter`. This is a medium-severity issue that could lead to locked tokens, but it is not covered in the response list.

---

### **[M-14] Owner can steal Concur rewards**

**Report Description**:
The owner of the `MasterChef` contract can steal `Concur` rewards by adding a depositor and inflating other depositors' assigned balance of the token within the contract. This allows the owner-managed depositor to claim most (all but one wei) of the created tokens, leading to unfair reward distribution and potential loss of funds for users.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of the owner stealing `Concur` rewards by manipulating depositor balances. While it mentions ""Centralization and Access Control Risks,"" it does not cover this specific exploit.

---

### **[M-15] Owner can lock tokens in MasterChef**

**Report Description**:
The owner of the `MasterChef` contract can lock tokens by removing a depositor from the whitelist. Since only depositors can deposit and withdraw, removing a depositor prevents users from withdrawing their funds, leading to locked tokens and potential loss of rewards.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of the owner locking tokens by removing depositors. While it mentions ""Centralization and Access Control Risks,"" it does not cover this specific vulnerability.

---

### **[M-16] Rewards get diluted because totalAllocPoint can only increase.**

**Report Description**:
The `MasterChef` contract lacks functionality to remove pools or adjust pool allocation points (`allocPoints`). As a result, `totalAllocPoint` can only increase, leading to diluted rewards for existing pools as new pools are added.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of reward dilution due to the inability to adjust `totalAllocPoint`. This is a medium-severity issue that impacts reward distribution, but it is not covered in the response list.

---

    require(
        rewardRate <= balance / rewardsDuration,
        ""Provided reward too high""
    );

In the current implementation, the contract only checks if balanceOf rewardsToken is greater than or equal to the future rewards.
However, under normal circumstances, since users can not withdraw all their rewards in time, the balance in the contract contains rewards that belong to the users but have not been withdrawn yet. This means the current checks can not be sufficient enough to make sure the contract has enough amount of rewardsToken.
As a result, if the rewardsDistribution mistakenly notifyRewardAmount with a larger amount, the contract may end up in a wrong state that makes some users unable to claim their rewards.
  [M-13] StakingRewards.recoverERC20 allows owner to rug the rewardsToken

Submitted by Alex the Entreprenerd, also found by pauliax
StakingRewards.sol#L166
StakingRewards.recoverERC20 rightfully checks against the stakingToken being sweeped away. However, there's no check against the rewardsToken which over time will sit in this contract.
This is the case of an admin privilege, which allows the owner to sweep the rewards tokens, perhaps as a way to rug depositors.
Proof of Concept

Calling StakingRewards.recoverERC20(rewardsToken, rewardsToken.balanceOf(this)) enables the owner to sweep the token.

**Report Description**:
The `ConvexStakingWrapper` and `StakingRewards` contracts incorrectly use `masterChef.deposit()` and `masterChef.withdraw()`. These functions take `_msgSender()` as the user address, which is actually the address of `ConvexStakingWrapper` and `StakingRewards` instead of the actual user. This misimplementation can lead to concur rewards being sent to the wrong receiver, potentially causing loss of funds or incorrect reward distribution.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Unsafe MasterChef Integration and External Contract Dependencies""**.

**Validation**:
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue with improper integration and validation of the MasterChef contract. It correctly highlights the risks associated with blindly trusting external contracts and the potential for cross-contract vulnerabilities, which aligns with the reported issue of rewards being sent to the wrong receiver due to incorrect `_msgSender()` usage.

---

### **[M-06] StakingRewards.sol recoverERC20() can be used as a backdoor by the owner to retrieve rewardsToken**

**Report Description**:
The `recoverERC20()` function in `StakingRewards.sol` allows the owner to retrieve ERC20 tokens, including the `rewardsToken`. While it checks against withdrawing the `stakingToken`, it does not prevent the owner from withdrawing the `rewardsToken`. This can be exploited as a backdoor to rug depositors by sweeping the rewards tokens.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Centralization and Access Control Risks""**.

**Validation**:
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue with excessive owner privileges and the risks associated with centralization. It correctly highlights the potential for a malicious or compromised owner to manipulate the contract, which aligns with the reported issue of the owner being able to rug depositors by withdrawing `rewardsToken`.

---

### **[M-09] StakingRewards.sol#notifyRewardAmount() Improper reward balance checks can make some users unable to withdraw their rewards**

**Report Description**:
The `notifyRewardAmount()` function in `StakingRewards.sol` checks if the `rewardsToken` balance is sufficient for future rewards but does not account for rewards that belong to users but have not yet been withdrawn. If the `rewardsDistribution` mistakenly notifies a larger reward amount, the contract may end up in a state where some users are unable to claim their rewards.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Arithmetic Vulnerabilities in Reward Calculations""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies issues with reward calculations but focuses on precision loss and arithmetic vulnerabilities rather than the specific issue of improper balance checks for unclaimed rewards. While related, the response does not fully address the reported problem of users being unable to withdraw their rewards due to insufficient balance checks.

---

### **[M-13] StakingRewards.recoverERC20 allows owner to rug the rewardsToken**

**Report Description**:
The `recoverERC20()` function in `StakingRewards.sol` allows the owner to sweep the `rewardsToken` without any checks, enabling the owner to rug depositors. This is a significant centralization risk, as the owner can withdraw all rewards tokens, leaving users unable to claim their rewards.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Centralization and Access Control Risks""**.

**Validation**:
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue with excessive owner privileges and the risks associated with centralization. It correctly highlights the potential for a malicious or compromised owner to manipulate the contract, which aligns with the reported issue of the owner being able to rug depositors by withdrawing `rewardsToken`.

Submitted by Alex the Entreprenerd, also found by gzeon, IllIllI, and leastwood
USDMPegRecovery.sol#L90 USDMPegRecovery.sol#L110 USDMPegRecovery.sol#L73 USDMPegRecovery.sol#L84
In USDMPegRecovery deposit and withdraw allow for direct deposits of a specific token (3crv or usdm).
The balances are directly changed and tracked in storage.
provide seems to be using the real balances (not the ones store) to provide liquidity. Because of how curve works, you'll be able (first deposit) to provide exactly matching liquidity. But after (even just 1 or) multiple swaps, the pool will be slightly imbalanced, adding or removing liquidity at that point will drastically change the balances in the contract from the ones tracked in storage.
Eventually users won't be able to withdraw the exact amounts they deposited.
This will culminate with real balances not matching user deposits, sometimes to user advantage and other times to user disadvantage, ultimately to the protocol dismay.

function withdraw(Liquidity calldata _withdrawal) external {
        Liquidity memory total = totalLiquidity;

However, because the withdraw() function takes funds from the balance of the contract, once the majority of the funds are added to the curve pool via provide(). The withdraw() may often fail due to insufficient funds in the balance.
  [M-04] USDMPegRecovery.sol#provide() Improper design/implementation make it often unable to add liquidity to the usdm3crv pool

Submitted by WatchPug
USDMPegRecovery.sol#L73-L82
function provide(uint256 _minimumLP) external onlyGuardian {
    require(usdm.balanceOf(address(this)) >= totalLiquidity.usdm, ""<liquidity"");
    // truncate amounts under step
    uint256 addingLiquidity = (usdm.balanceOf(address(this)) / step) * step;

    pool3.approve(address(usdm3crv), addingLiquidity);
    usdm3crv.add_liquidity(amounts, _minimumLP);
}

In the current implementation of USDMPegRecovery.sol#provide(), addingLiquidity is calculated solely based on usdm balance (truncate at a step of 250k), and it always uses the same amount of 3pool tokens to add_liquidity with.
Based on other functions of the contract, the balance of usdm can usually be more than the pool3 balance, in that case, usdm3crv.add_liquidity() will fail.
  [M-05] USDM locked unless guardian remove liquidity

Submitted by gzeon
In README.me:
USDM deposits are locked based on the KPI’s from carrot.eth
However, USDM deposits are also locked until guardian remove liquidity because there are no mechanism to remove deposited USDM in withdraw.
USDMPegRecovery.sol#L90
  [M-12] USDMPegRecovery.provide() Will Fail If There Is An Excess Of usdm Tokens

Submitted by leastwood
The provide function does not take a _steps argument and will instead calculate addingLiquidity by truncating amounts under step. As a result, if there is an excess of usdm such that the truncated amount exceeds the contract's pool3 truncated balance, then the function will revert due to insufficient pool3 collateral.
This will prevent guardians from effectively providing liquidity whenever tokens are available. Consider the following example:
The contract has 500000e18 usdm tokens and 250000e18 pool3 tokens.
addingLiquidity will be calculated as 500000e18 / 250000e18 * 250000e18.
The function will attempt to add 500000e18 usdm and pool3 tokens in which there are insufficient pool3 tokens in the contract. As a result, it will revert even though there is an abundance of tokens that satisfy the step amount.

Based on the detailed examination of this contract, I notice it implements a specialized liquidity management system designed to help recover the peg of the USDM stablecoin through controlled interactions with a Curve metapool. The contract utilizes a guardian system for privileged operations and a conditional withdrawal mechanism that only unlocks USDM withdrawals when triggered by an external oracle.","I'll analyze the provided issues and consolidate similar ones according to your requirements.

**Report Description**:  
The `USDMPegRecovery` contract allows direct deposits of `3crv` or `usdm` tokens. The balances are tracked in storage, but the `provide` function uses real balances (not the stored ones) to provide liquidity. Due to how Curve pools work, after swaps, the pool becomes imbalanced, and adding or removing liquidity will drastically change the contract's balances compared to the stored values. This discrepancy will eventually prevent users from withdrawing the exact amounts they deposited, leading to mismatches between real balances and user deposits, sometimes to the user's advantage and other times to their disadvantage, ultimately harming the protocol.

**Match in Response List**:  
No direct match found. However, the response titled **""Improper liquidity management in provide function""** partially addresses the issue by highlighting the lack of checks for sufficient `pool3` tokens and the rounding issue in liquidity calculations. It does not fully cover the discrepancy between Curve LP token values and internal contract math.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies some aspects of the issue, such as improper liquidity management and rounding errors, but it misses the core problem of discrepancies between Curve LP token values and internal contract math, which is the primary risk described in the issue.

---

### **[M-03] USDMPegRecovery.sol#withdraw() withdraw may often fail**

**Report Description**:  
The `withdraw` function in `USDMPegRecovery.sol` takes funds from the contract's balance. However, once the majority of the funds are added to the Curve pool via `provide`, the `withdraw` function may often fail due to insufficient funds in the contract's balance, even if users have sufficient tracked balances.

**Match in Response List**:  
No direct match found. The response titled **""Lack of withdrawal validation against user balance""** discusses underflow risks but does not address the issue of insufficient contract balances causing withdrawal failures.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response misidentifies the core issue. The problem here is not underflow but the inability to withdraw due to insufficient contract balances after liquidity is provided to the Curve pool.

---

### **[M-04] USDMPegRecovery.sol#provide() Improper design/implementation make it often unable to add liquidity to the usdm3crv pool**

**Report Description**:  
The `provide` function calculates `addingLiquidity` based solely on the `usdm` balance, truncating it at a step of 250k. It always uses the same amount of `pool3` tokens to add liquidity, which can fail if the `usdm` balance exceeds the `pool3` balance, preventing liquidity provision.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the response titled **""Improper liquidity management in provide function""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue with improper liquidity management, including the lack of checks for sufficient `pool3` tokens and the rounding issue in liquidity calculations, which aligns with the issue described.

---

### **[M-05] USDM locked unless guardian remove liquidity**

**Report Description**:  
USDM deposits are locked based on KPIs from `carrot.eth`, but they are also locked until the guardian removes liquidity because there is no mechanism to remove deposited USDM in `withdraw`.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the response titled **""Incomplete USDM unlock mechanism""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response correctly identifies the issue with the incomplete USDM unlock mechanism, highlighting the dependency on the guardian to remove liquidity, which aligns with the issue described.

### **[M-12] USDMPegRecovery.provide() Will Fail If There Is An Excess Of usdm Tokens**

**Report Description**:  
The `provide` function calculates `addingLiquidity` by truncating amounts under `step`. If there is an excess of `usdm` such that the truncated amount exceeds the contract's `pool3` truncated balance, the function will revert due to insufficient `pool3` collateral, preventing guardians from effectively providing liquidity.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the response titled **""Improper liquidity management in provide function""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue with improper liquidity management, including the lack of checks for sufficient `pool3` tokens and the rounding issue in liquidity calculations, which aligns with the issue described.

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:

- **[M-04] USDMPegRecovery.sol#provide() Improper design/implementation make it often unable to add liquidity to the usdm3crv pool**
- **[M-05] USDM locked unless guardian remove liquidity**
- **[M-12] USDMPegRecovery.provide() Will Fail If There Is An Excess Of usdm Tokens**

**Partially Correct Matches**:

- **[H-05] USDMPegRecovery Risk of fund locked, due to discrepancy between curveLP token value against internal contract math**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:

- **[M-03] USDMPegRecovery.sol#withdraw() withdraw may often fail**
