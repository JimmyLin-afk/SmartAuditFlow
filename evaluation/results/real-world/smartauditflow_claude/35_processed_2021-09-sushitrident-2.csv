}",6722.0,716.0,"[H-01] Unsafe cast in ConcentratedLiquidityPool.burn leads to attack

Submitted by cmichel, also found by broccoli
The `ConcentratedLiquidityPool.burn` function performs an unsafe cast of a `uint128` type to a signed integer.
(uint256 amount0fees, uint256 amount1fees) = _updatePosition(msg.sender, lower, upper, -int128(amount));

Note that amount is chosen by the caller and when choosing amount = 2**128 - 1, this is interpreted as 0xFFFFFFFFF... = -1 as a signed integer. Thus -(-1)=1 adds 1 liquidity unit to the position
This allows an attacker to not only mint LP tokens for free but as this is the burn function it also redeems token0/1 amounts according to the unmodified uint128 amount which is an extremely large value.
 [H-04] Overflow in the mint function of ConcentratedLiquidityPool causes LPs' funds to be stolen

Impact

Similar to a previous finding in the IndexPool contract, the `mint` function of ConcentratedLiquidityPool allows integer overflows when checking the balance is larger or equal to the received amount of token plus the reserve. As a result, the attacker could get a large amount of liquidity but only provide a small number of tokens to the pool, effectively stealing other LPs' funds when burning his liquidity.
Notice that this bug is independent of another bug of incorrect casting uint256 type to uint128 in the _getAmountsForLiquidity function. Even if the previously mentioned bug does not exist, the attacker could still steal the funds in the pool by exploiting this bug.
 [H-05] Incorrect usage of typecasting in _getAmountsForLiquidity lets an attacker steal funds from the pool

Impact

The `_getAmountsForLiquidity` function of ConcentratedLiquidityPool explicitly converts the result of DyDxMath.getDy and DyDxMath.getDx from type uint256 to type uint128. The explicit casting without checking whether the integer exceeds the maximum number (i.e., type(uint128).max) could cause incorrect results being used. Specifically, an attacker could exploit this bug to mint a large amount of liquidity but only pay a little of token0 or token1 to the pool and effectively steal other's funds when burning his liquidity.
  [H-08] Wrong inequality when adding/removing liquidity in current price range

The `ConcentratedLiquidityPool.mint/burn` functions add/remove liquidity when (priceLower < currentPrice && currentPrice < priceUpper). Shouldn't it also be changed if priceLower == currentPrice?

[H-09] range fee growth underflow

The function RangeFeeGrowth (ConcentratedLiquidityPool.sol#L601-L633) would revert the transaction in some cases.
When a pool cross a tick, it only updates either feeGrowthOutside0 or feeGrowthOutside1. Ticks.sol#L23-L53
RangeFeeGrowth calculates the fee as follow:
    feeGrowthInside0 = _feeGrowthGlobal0 - feeGrowthBelow0 - feeGrowthAbove0;
    feeGrowthInside1 = _feeGrowthGlobal1 - feeGrowthBelow1 - feeGrowthAbove1;

feeGrowthBelow + feeGrowthAbove is not necessary smaller than _feeGrowthGlobal. Please see POC.
Users can not provide liquidity or burn liquidity. Fund will get stocked in the contract. I consider this is a high-risk issue.
 [H-10] ConcentratedLiquidityPool.burn() Wrong implementation
 The reserves should be updated once LP tokens are burned to match the actual total bento shares hold by the pool.
However, the current implementation only updated reserves with the fees subtracted.
Makes the reserve0 and reserve1 smaller than the current balance0 and balance1.
 [H-11] ConcentratedLiquidityPool: incorrect feeGrowthGlobal accounting when crossing ticks

Variable `feeGrowthGlobal` 

Swap fees are taken from the output. Hence, if swapping token0 for token1 (zeroForOne is true), then fees are taken in token1. We see this to be the case in the initialization of feeGrowthGlobal in the swap cache
feeGrowthGlobal = zeroForOne ? feeGrowthGlobal1 : feeGrowthGlobal0;
and in _updateFees().
However, looking at Ticks.cross(), the logic is the reverse, which causes wrong fee accounting.
``` if (zeroForOne) {
	...
	ticks[nextTickToCross].feeGrowthOutside0 = feeGrowthGlobal - ticks[nextTickToCross].feeGrowthOutside0;
} else {
	...
	ticks[nextTickToCross].feeGrowthOutside1 = feeGrowthGlobal - ticks[nextTickToCross].feeGrowthOutside1;
}
```  [H-12] ConcentratedLiquidityPool: secondsPerLiquidity should be modified whenever pool liquidity changes

Variable `secondsPerLiquidity`

`secondsPerLiquidity` is updated as such: `secondsPerLiquidity += uint160((diff << 128) / liquidity); where diff = timestamp - uint256(lastObservation)`. Hence, whenever liquidity changes, secondsPerLiquidity should be updated prior to the change.
In particular, this affects the mint() and burn() functions, in the case where liquidity changes when lowerTick <= currentTick < upperTick.
In fact, the latest secondsPerLiquidity value should be calculated and used in Ticks.insert(). For comparison, notice how UniswapV3 fetches the latest value by calling observations.observeSingle() in its _updatePosition() function.
 [H-13] Burning does not update reserves


The ConcentratedLiquidityPool.burn function sends out amount0/amount1 tokens but only updates the reserves by decreasing it by the fees of these amounts.
``` unchecked {
    // @audit decreases by fees only, not by amount0/amount1
    reserve0 -= uint128(amount0fees);
    reserve1 -= uint128(amount1fees);
}
```
This leads to the pool having wrong reserves after any burn action. The pool's balance will be much lower than the reserve variables.
 [H-14] ConcentratedLiquidityPool: `rangeFeeGrowth` and `secondsPerLiquidity` math needs to be unchecked


The fee growth mechanism, and by extension, secondsPerLiquidity mechanism of Uniswap V3 has the ability to underflow. It is therefore a necessity for the math to (ironically) be unsafe / unchecked.",10.0,,"pragma solidity >=0.8.0;

  ]
}

Key potential vulnerabilities I identified during my review:

1. The contract uses custom mathematical libraries like `FullMath` and `UnsafeMath` for critical calculations, which could introduce precision errors in price and fee calculations.

2. The `_ensureTickSpacing` function enforces constraints on tick values, but a more comprehensive analysis of tick bounds is needed to ensure they can't be manipulated.

3. The reentrancy protection only works within the same contract because it's implemented as a modifier. Cross-contract reentrancy could still be possible.

4. The contract has interactions with external contracts during mint/swap operations that could potentially be manipulated if those contracts are malicious.

5. Protocol fee collection logic seems well-implemented but needs verification that fees can't be collected by unauthorized users.

The contract appears to be a sophisticated implementation of a concentrated liquidity AMM, similar to Uniswap V3, with robust fee tracking and liquidity management mechanisms.","I've analyzed the provided findings about the ConcentratedLiquidityPool smart contract. After combining similar issues and organizing them by severity, here is the consolidated report:

{
  ""Findings"": [
    {
      ""Issue"": ""Reentrancy vulnerability in external calls"",
      ""Severity"": ""High"",
      ""Description"": ""The contract makes external calls to potentially untrusted contracts during mint and swap operations. While the contract uses a lock modifier, it makes external calls to ITridentCallee(msg.sender).tridentMintCallback() and IPositionManager(mintParams.positionOwner).positionMintCallback() after state changes but before updating reserves. This creates a potential reentrancy vulnerability as malicious contracts could reenter the pool through these callbacks."",
      ""Impact"": ""An attacker could potentially reenter the contract and manipulate pool state or drain funds before the original transaction completes its state updates, potentially stealing funds or corrupting pool state."",
      ""Location"": ""mint() function external callbacks, particularly around lines 193-217""
    },
    {
      ""Issue"": ""Lack of slippage protection in swap"",
      ""Severity"": ""High"",
      ""Description"": ""The swap function doesn't include a minimum output amount parameter or other slippage protection mechanisms, which means users have no built-in protection against price movements. Without this protection, users might receive significantly fewer tokens than expected due to price movements, MEV attacks, or sandwich attacks."",
      ""Impact"": ""Users could experience significant financial losses through sandwich attacks or front-running, where attackers manipulate the price before and after a victim's transaction, causing them to receive much less output than expected."",
      ""Location"": ""swap function (lines 234-310)""
    },
    {
      ""Issue"": ""Price manipulation vulnerability"",
      ""Severity"": ""High"",
      ""Description"": ""The contract could be vulnerable to price manipulation attacks, especially in low liquidity scenarios.

### **Detailed Analysis**

---

#### **[H-01] Unsafe cast in ConcentratedLiquidityPool.burn leads to attack**

**Report Description**:
The `ConcentratedLiquidityPool.burn` function performs an unsafe cast of a `uint128` type to a signed integer. This allows an attacker to mint LP tokens for free and redeem token0/1 amounts according to an unmodified `uint128` amount, which can be an extremely large value.

**Match in Response List**:
Partially matches with the issue titled **""Unchecked arithmetic operations""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the issue of unchecked arithmetic operations but does not specifically address the unsafe cast from `uint128` to a signed integer. The core issue of unsafe casting is missed, though the broader context of unchecked arithmetic is relevant.

---

#### **[H-04] Overflow in the mint function of ConcentratedLiquidityPool causes LPs' funds to be stolen**

**Report Description**:
The `mint` function allows integer overflows when checking the balance, enabling an attacker to get a large amount of liquidity while providing a small number of tokens, effectively stealing other LPs' funds.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Unchecked arithmetic operations""**.

**Validation**:
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue of unchecked arithmetic operations, which includes the risk of integer overflow in the `mint` function. The impact of stealing LPs' funds is also correctly identified.

---

#### **[H-05] Incorrect usage of typecasting in _getAmountsForLiquidity lets an attacker steal funds from the pool**

**Report Description**:
The `_getAmountsForLiquidity` function explicitly converts `uint256` to `uint128` without checking for overflow, allowing an attacker to mint a large amount of liquidity while paying little, effectively stealing funds.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Unchecked arithmetic operations""**.

**Validation**:
**Correct**. The response correctly identifies the issue of unchecked arithmetic operations, which includes the risk of incorrect typecasting. The impact of stealing funds is also accurately described.

---

#### **[H-08] Wrong inequality when adding/removing liquidity in current price range**

**Report Description**:
The `ConcentratedLiquidityPool.mint/burn` functions add/remove liquidity when `(priceLower < currentPrice && currentPrice < priceUpper)`, but should also handle the case where `priceLower == currentPrice`.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Missed Issue**. The response list does not address this issue, which could lead to incorrect liquidity calculations.

---

#### **[H-09] range fee growth underflow**

**Report Description**:
The `RangeFeeGrowth` function may revert due to underflow when calculating `feeGrowthInside0` and `feeGrowthInside1`, preventing users from providing or burning liquidity.

**Match in Response List**:
Partially matches with the issue titled **""Potential integer overflow in rangeSecondsInside calculation""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the risk of integer overflow/underflow but does not specifically address the `RangeFeeGrowth` function or its impact on liquidity provision.

---

#### **[H-10] ConcentratedLiquidityPool.burn() Wrong implementation**

**Report Description**:
The `burn` function updates reserves only with the fees subtracted, making `reserve0` and `reserve1` smaller than the actual balances, leading to incorrect reserve accounting.

**Match in Response List**:
Partially matches with the issue titled **""Token balance validation only after state changes""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the issue of incorrect state updates but does not specifically address the reserve accounting problem in the `burn` function.

---

#### **[H-11] ConcentratedLiquidityPool: incorrect feeGrowthGlobal accounting when crossing ticks**

**Report Description**:
The `Ticks.cross` function incorrectly updates `feeGrowthOutside0` and `feeGrowthOutside1`, leading to wrong fee accounting when crossing ticks.

**Match in Response List**:
Partially matches with the issue titled **""Unhandled edge cases in tick crossing""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies edge cases in tick crossing but does not specifically address the incorrect fee accounting issue.

---

#### **[H-12] ConcentratedLiquidityPool: secondsPerLiquidity should be modified whenever pool liquidity changes**

**Report Description**:
The `secondsPerLiquidity` variable should be updated whenever liquidity changes, but this is not consistently done in the `mint` and `burn` functions.

**Match in Response List**:
Partially matches with the issue titled **""Timestamp manipulation vulnerability""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the use of `block.timestamp` but does not specifically address the issue of updating `secondsPerLiquidity` when liquidity changes.

---

#### **[H-13] Burning does not update reserves**

**Report Description**:
The `burn` function updates reserves only by the fees subtracted, not by the actual `amount0/amount1` tokens sent, leading to incorrect reserve accounting.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Token balance validation only after state changes""**.

**Validation**:
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue of incorrect state updates, which includes the reserve accounting problem in the `burn` function.

---

#### **[H-14] ConcentratedLiquidityPool: rangeFeeGrowth and secondsPerLiquidity math needs to be unchecked**

**Report Description**:
The `rangeFeeGrowth` and `secondsPerLiquidity` calculations may underflow, and the math should be unchecked to prevent reverts.

**Match in Response List**:
Partially matches with the issue titled **""Potential integer overflow in rangeSecondsInside calculation""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the risk of integer overflow/underflow but does not specifically address the `rangeFeeGrowth` and `secondsPerLiquidity` calculations.",3,6,1,18,"```
1. Overflow in the mint function of ConcentratedLiquidityPool causes LPs' funds to be stolen
2. Incorrect usage of typecasting in _getAmountsForLiquidity lets an attacker steal funds from the pool
3. Burning does not update reserves
```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the ranks at which the true positives appear in the ranked list of predictions**.
2. **Calculate the precision at each rank where a true positive appears**.
3. **Average the precision values to compute the AP**.

### Step 1: Identify the ranks of true positives
The true positives are:
1. ""Overflow in the mint function of ConcentratedLiquidityPool causes LPs' funds to be stolen""
2. ""Incorrect usage of typecasting in _getAmountsForLiquidity lets an attacker steal funds from the pool""
3. ""Burning does not update reserves""

We need to check if these true positives appear in the ranked list of predictions. However, the provided ranked list of predictions does not explicitly match these true positives. Therefore, we assume that none of the true positives appear in the ranked list of predictions.

### Step 2: Calculate precision at each rank
Since none of the true positives appear in the ranked list of predictions, the precision at any rank where a true positive would appear is 0.

### Step 3: Compute the AP
Since there are no true positives in the ranked list, the **Average Precision (AP)** is 0.

}",1294.0,116.0,"[H-02] Wrong usage of positionId in ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager

Impact

In the `subscribe` function of ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager, the incentive to subscribed is determined as follows:
Incentive memory incentive = incentives[pool][positionId];

However, positionId should be incentiveId, a counter that increases by one whenever a new incentive is added to the pool. The usage of positionId could cause the wrong incentive to be used, and in general, the incentive is not found, and the transaction reverts (the condition `block.timestamp < incentive.endTime` is not met). The getReward and claimReward functions have the bug of misusing positionId as the index of incentives.
 [H-03] ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager's incentives can be stolen

The ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager keeps all tokens for all incentives in the same contract. The `reclaimIncentive` function does not reduce the incentive.rewardsUnclaimed field and thus one can reclaim tokens several times. This allows anyone to steal all tokens from all incentives by creating an incentive themself, and once it's expired, repeatedly claim the unclaimed rewards until the token balance is empty.
 [H-16] Possible attacks on Seconds * Liquidity calculation

This is a possible line of attack on the staking contract, in particular the `claimReward()` function: ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager.sol#L90 L94
A user with some spare capital mints a liquidity position with a very tight range (1-2 ticks wide) at the current price. Because the range is so small, his position.liquidity on his NFT is large (DyDxMath.sol).
The user then sets up a bot to frontrun any price changes that someone else tries to do, burning his position after claiming rewards. He then mints a new liquidity position at the new price after the other persons trades go through.
Rinse and repeat this process. If done correctly, no funds are at risk from the bot owner, he doesn't pay any fees for burning/minting either.
So what you have left is a sequence of positions with high position.liquidity and in the correct price range all the time, without taking on any risk. Thereby stealing incentive funds.
  [M-01] Incentive should check that it hasn't started yet

The `ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager.addIncentive` function can add an incentive that already has a non-zero incentive.secondsClaimed.

[M-02] Cannot claim reward

The `ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager.claimReward` requires stake.initialized but it is never set. It also performs a strange computation as 128 - incentive.secondsClaimed which will almost always underflow and revert the transaction.
 [M-06] ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager.sol `claimReward()` and `reclaimIncentive()` will fail when incentive.token is token0 or token1

In `ConcentratedLiquidityPosition.collect()`, balances of token0 and token1 in bento will be used to pay the fees.
 In the case of someone add an incentive with `token0` or `token1`, the incentive in the balance of bento will be used to pay fees until the balance is completely consumed.
As a result, when a user calls claimReward(), the contract may not have enough balance to pay (it supposed to have it), cause the transaction to fail.",6.0,,"pragma solidity >=0.8.0;

---

#### **[H-02] Wrong usage of positionId in ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager**

**Report Description**:  
In the `subscribe` function of `ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager`, the incentive to be subscribed is determined using `positionId` instead of `incentiveId`. This could cause the wrong incentive to be used, leading to transaction reverts or incorrect incentive handling. The same issue exists in the `getReward` and `claimReward` functions.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Incorrect incentive mapping access in multiple functions""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the core issue of using `positionId` instead of `incentiveId` in multiple functions. It correctly explains the impact of this error, which aligns with the issue report.

---

#### **[H-03] ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager's incentives can be stolen**

**Report Description**:  
The `reclaimIncentive` function does not reduce the `incentive.rewardsUnclaimed` field, allowing tokens to be reclaimed multiple times. This could lead to the theft of all tokens from all incentives by repeatedly claiming unclaimed rewards.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Incomplete state management in reclaimIncentive""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the issue of incomplete state management in `reclaimIncentive` but does not explicitly mention the potential for token theft. It focuses on the inconsistency between state and token balances, which is related but misses the critical impact described in the issue report.

---

#### **[H-16] Possible attacks on Seconds * Liquidity calculation**

**Report Description**:  
A user can exploit the `claimReward` function by minting a liquidity position with a very tight range, frontrunning price changes, and repeatedly claiming rewards without taking on any risk. This allows the user to steal incentive funds.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The described attack vector is unique and not covered in the consolidated report.

---

#### **[M-01] Incentive should check that it hasn't started yet**

**Report Description**:  
The `addIncentive` function does not check if the incentive has already started (i.e., `incentive.secondsClaimed` is non-zero). This could lead to incorrect incentive handling.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The lack of validation for `incentive.secondsClaimed` is a missed vulnerability.

---

#### **[M-02] Cannot claim reward**

**Report Description**:  
The `claimReward` function requires `stake.initialized`, which is never set. Additionally, the calculation `128 - incentive.secondsClaimed` is prone to underflow, causing the transaction to revert.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential integer overflow in secondsUnclaimed calculation""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the overflow issue in the calculation but does not mention the uninitialized `stake.initialized` field, which is a critical part of the issue.

---

#### **[M-06] ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager.sol `claimReward()` and `reclaimIncentive()` will fail when incentive.token is token0 or token1**

**Report Description**:  
If `incentive.token` is `token0` or `token1`, the balance in the Bento contract may be used to pay fees, leaving insufficient funds for `claimReward` or `reclaimIncentive`. This could cause transactions to fail.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The potential failure due to insufficient balance is a missed vulnerability.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:
- **[H-02] Wrong usage of positionId in ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager**

**Partially Correct Matches**:
- **[H-03] ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager's incentives can be stolen**
- **[M-02] Cannot claim reward**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:
- **[H-16] Possible attacks on Seconds * Liquidity calculation**
- **[M-01] Incentive should check that it hasn't started yet**
- **[M-06] ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager.sol `claimReward()` and `reclaimIncentive()` will fail when incentive.token is token0 or token1**

---

### **Conclusion**  
The response list covers some of the issues in the issue report but misses several critical vulnerabilities, particularly those related to incentive theft, timestamp manipulation, and insufficient balance checks. Additionally, some responses are partially correct, as they identify the core issue but miss important details or impacts. A more comprehensive review is needed to address all identified vulnerabilities.",1,2,3,9,"```
1. Incorrect incentive mapping access in multiple functions
```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the rank of the true positive**:
   - The true positive is ""Incorrect incentive mapping access in multiple functions"".
   - This issue appears at **rank 1** in the ranked list of predictions.

2. **Calculate the precision at that rank**:
   - Precision at rank 1 (\( P@1 \)) is calculated as the number of true positives up to rank 1 divided by the total number of items up to rank 1.
   - \( P@1 = \frac{1}{1} = 1.0 \).

3. **Compute the Average Precision (AP)**:
   - Since there is only one true positive, the AP is simply the precision at the rank where the true positive appears.
   - \( AP = 1.0 \).

**Output**:

This contract is a sophisticated implementation for managing concentrated liquidity positions as NFTs. It has similarities with Uniswap V3's approach to liquidity positions but is integrated with a system called BentoBox for token transfers. The contract allows minting positions, burning them, and collecting accumulated fees while tracking position data like liquidity amounts and tick ranges.

Notable insights:
1. The contract uses a callback pattern for minting positions, where pools call back to this contract.
2. Fee collection uses a complex formula based on fee growth inside ticks.
3. The contract handles both full and partial burns of positions.
4. It allows users to choose between wrapped (in BentoBox) and unwrapped token transfers.","I'll analyze and combine similar issues from the provided findings while maintaining key information about each security issue.

      ""Description"": ""While the function checks that msg.sender is a registered pool with the masterDeployer, there's no verification that the pool is calling this function in the expected context or that it's associated with the specific position being minted. Any registered pool could call this function directly to create arbitrary positions for any recipient."",
      ""Impact"": ""Malicious pools could create unauthorized positions with arbitrary parameters, potentially leading to confusion or theft of funds when users interact with positions they believe are legitimate. This could allow attackers to forge position data and mint NFTs without actual liquidity being provided."",

      ""Severity"": ""High"",
      ""Description"": ""The contract makes external calls to untrusted contracts (position.pool.burn, position.pool.collect) before updating its state variables. This pattern creates a potential re-entrancy vulnerability, especially since the contract is interacting with arbitrary pool implementations that could contain malicious code."",

**Report Description**:
When a user calls `ConcentratedLiquidityPosition.sol#collect()` to collect their yield, it calculates the yield based on `position.pool.rangeFeeGrowth()` and `position.feeGrowthInside0`, `position.feeGrowthInside1`. If there are enough tokens in `bento.balanceOf`, it will not call `position.pool.collect()` to collect fees from the pool. This allows users who call `collect()` when there is enough balance to get double yield when they call `burn()` to remove liquidity, as `burn()` will automatically collect fees from the pool contract.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The issue describes a specific scenario where users can double their yield due to the interaction between `collect()` and `burn()`. None of the responses in the `response_list` address this specific issue. The closest match is the ""Incorrect token amount calculation in collect function,"" but it does not cover the double yield scenario described in the issue.

---

### **[H-07] ConcentratedLiquidityPosition.sol#burn() Wrong implementation allows attackers to steal yield**

**Report Description**:
When a user calls `ConcentratedLiquidityPosition.sol#burn()` to burn their liquidity, it calls `ConcentratedLiquidityPool.sol#burn()` -> `_updatePosition()`. The `_updatePosition()` function returns `amount0fees` and `amount1fees` of the whole position with the `lower` and `upper` tick and sends them to the `recipient` alongside the burned liquidity amounts. This implementation allows attackers to steal yield by manipulating the fee collection process.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The issue describes a vulnerability where attackers can steal yield due to the implementation of `burn()` and `_updatePosition()`. None of the responses in the `response_list` address this specific issue. The closest match is the ""Lack of Re-entrancy Protection,"" but it does not cover the yield theft scenario described in the issue.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:
- **[H-06] ConcentratedLiquidityPosition.sol#collect() Users may get double the amount of yield when they call collect() before burn()**
- **[H-07] ConcentratedLiquidityPosition.sol#burn() Wrong implementation allows attackers to steal yield**

---

### **Conclusion**
The `response_list` does not adequately address the specific vulnerabilities described in the `issue` report. Both issues ([H-06] and [H-07]) are missed entirely, indicating a significant gap in the coverage of the responses. The responses in the `response_list` focus on general security concerns but fail to capture the nuanced vulnerabilities related to yield calculation and theft in the `collect()` and `burn()` functions.",0,0,2,14,"```

**[M-05] TridentNFT.permit should always check recoveredAddress != 0**

**Report Description**:
The `TridentNFT.permit` function ignores the `recoveredAddress != 0` check if `isApprovedForAll[owner][recoveredAddress]` is true. If a user accidentally sets the zero address as the operator, tokens can be stolen by anyone because a wrong signature yields `recoveredAddress == 0`. This oversight allows malicious actors to exploit the zero address to gain unauthorized access to tokens.

**Match in Response List**:
No match found.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The issue is not addressed in the `response_list`. While the `response_list` includes a finding titled **""Permit Function Signature Vulnerability""**, it focuses on the broader issue of approved operators creating permits on behalf of the owner, which does not directly address the specific vulnerability of ignoring the `recoveredAddress != 0` check. The response does not mention the zero address or the risk of token theft due to this oversight, making it insufficient for this issue.
