",4847,684,"[H-01] Controller.setCap sets wrong vault balance

Submitted by cmichel
The `Controller.setCap` function sets a cap for a strategy and withdraws any excess amounts (_diff). The vault balance is decreased by the entire strategy balance instead of by this _diff: ```
// @audit why not sub _diff?
_vaultDetails[_vault].balance = _vaultDetails[_vault].balance.sub(_balance);
```  [H-02] set cap breaks vault's Balance

In controller.sol's function setCap, the contract wrongly handles _vaultDetails[_vault].balance. While the balance should be decreased by the difference of strategies balance, it subtracts the remaining balance of the strategy. See Controller.sol L262-L278. `_vaultDetails[_vault].balance = _vaultDetails[_vault].balance.sub(_balance);`
This would result in vaultDetails[_vault].balance being far smaller than the strategy's value. A user would trigger the assertion at Controller.sol#475 and the fund would be locked in the strategy.
Though setCap is a permission function that only the operator can call, it's likely to be called and the fund would be locked in the contract. I consider this a high severity issue.
  [H-04] Controller does not raise an error when there's insufficient liquidity

MEV, TOD attack

When a user tries to withdraw the token from the vault, the vault would withdraw the token from the controller if there's insufficient liquidity in the vault. However, the controller does not raise an error when there's insufficient liquidity in the controller/ strategies. The user would lose his shares while getting nothing.
An MEV searcher could apply this attack on any withdrawal. When an attacker found an unconfirmed tx that tries to withdraw 1M dai, he can do such sandwich attack.
Deposits USDC into the vault.
Withdraw all dai left in the vault/controller/strategy.
Place the vitims tx here. The victim would get zero dai while burning 1 M share. This would pump the share price.
Withdraw all liquidity.
All users would be vulnerable to MEV attackers. I consider this is a high-risk issue.  [H-09] `removeToken` would break the vault/protocol.

There's no safety check in Manager.sol's removeToken. `Manager.sol#L454-L487`
The token would be locked in the original vault. Given the current design, the vault would keep a ratio of total amount to save the gas. Once the token is removed at manager contract, these token would lost.
Controller's balanceOf would no longer reflects the real value. Controller.sol#L488-L495 While _vaultDetails[msg.sender].balance; remains the same, user can nolonger withdraw those amount.
Share price in the vault would decrease drastically. The share price is calculated as totalValue / totalSupply Vault.sol#L217. While the totalSupply of the share remains the same, the total balance has drastically decreased.
Calling removeToken way would almost break the whole protocol if the vault has already started. I consider this is a high-risk issue.

[M-08] Controller.inCaseStrategyGetStuck does not update balance

The `Controller.inCaseStrategyGetStuck` withdraws from a strategy but does not call updateBalance(_vault, _strategy) afterwards.

The _vaultDetails[_vault].balances[_strategy] variable does not correctly track the actual strategy balance anymore. I'm not sure what exactly this field is used for besides getting the withdraw amounts per strategy in getBestStrategyWithdraw. As the strategy contains a lower amount than stored in the field, Controller.withdraw will attempt to withdraw too much.

Based on my analysis, this Controller contract serves as the central coordination hub in a yield farming system similar to Yearn Finance. It manages the relationship between vaults (which hold user deposits) and strategies (which deploy those assets to generate yield). The contract implements several security features like access control, caps on strategy allocations, and balance tracking. 

The main potential risks appear to be around the token conversion process (potential slippage issues), the optimal withdrawal algorithm (which might fail under certain market conditions), and the strategy management process. The contract is complex with multiple interdependencies that would require thorough testing and auditing.","After analyzing the provided findings, I've consolidated similar issues and organized them by severity. Here's the consolidated security analysis:

{
  ""Findings"": [
    {
      ""Issue"": ""Potential Reentrancy in Strategy Interactions"",
      ""Severity"": ""High"",
      ""Description"": ""The contract makes multiple external calls to strategies, converters, and other contracts without following the checks-effects-interactions pattern consistently. External calls are made before updating state variables in several functions, creating a reentrancy vulnerability. If a malicious strategy is added, it could reenter and manipulate the controller's state."",
      ""Impact"": ""A malicious strategy or converter could reenter the controller during execution, potentially draining funds or manipulating state to gain unauthorized access to assets. This could lead to significant fund loss for the protocol and its users."",
      ""Location"": ""withdraw(), earn(), withdrawAll() functions and other functions making external calls to strategies before state updates""
    },
    {
      ""Issue"": ""Lack of Slippage Protection in Conversion Operations"",
      ""Severity"": ""High"",
      ""Description"": ""When converting tokens (e.g., in earn(), withdraw(), and withdrawAll()), a hardcoded slippage value of 1 is used in converter.convert() calls, which effectively allows nearly 100% slippage. This provides insufficient protection against market volatility and makes transactions vulnerable to sandwich attacks and front-running."",
      ""Impact"": ""Users could receive significantly fewer tokens than expected due to MEV attacks, price manipulation, or high volatility during conversions. This could lead to substantial financial losses for users, especially during volatile market conditions."",
      ""Location"": ""Multiple functions including earn(), withdraw(), withdrawAll(), and setCap() where converter.convert() is called with a minimum amount of 1""
    },
    {
      ""Issue"": ""Balance Accounting Errors and Inconsistencies"",
      ""Severity"": ""High"",
      ""Description"": ""The contract has several issues with balance tracking and accounting. In withdrawAll(), there's conditional logic that sets balance to 0 if it's less than the amount, rather than properly handling the discrepancy. In withdraw() and other functions, the contract updates balances after external calls without verifying the actual transferred amounts. The contract doesn't always update stored balances when strategies modify funds."",
      ""Impact"": ""Could lead to inconsistent accounting where tracked balances don't match actual strategy balances. This could allow some users to withdraw more than their fair share or lead to funds being stuck in the contract. Over time, these discrepancies could accumulate and potentially lead to significant fund loss."",

      ""Description"": ""The addStrategy() function checks if a strategy is already added globally but doesn't prevent a strategy that was previously added and removed from being added again, potentially to a different vault. The removeStrategy() function calls the strategy's withdrawAll() method but doesn't verify if all funds were actually returned before removing the strategy from tracking."",

---

#### **[H-01] Controller.setCap sets wrong vault balance**

**Report Description**:
The `Controller.setCap` function sets a cap for a strategy and withdraws any excess amounts (`_diff`). However, the vault balance is decreased by the entire strategy balance instead of by `_diff`. This results in `vaultDetails[_vault].balance` being far smaller than the strategy's value, potentially locking funds in the strategy. This is a high-severity issue as it can be triggered by the operator, leading to fund lockup.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this specific issue of incorrect balance subtraction in `setCap`. The issue is critical as it directly impacts the vault's balance and can lead to fund lockup, but it is not covered in the response list.

---

#### **[H-02] setCap breaks vault's Balance**

**Report Description**:
The `setCap` function in `Controller.sol` incorrectly handles `_vaultDetails[_vault].balance`. Instead of subtracting the difference (`_diff`) of the strategy's balance, it subtracts the entire strategy balance. This results in `vaultDetails[_vault].balance` being significantly smaller than the strategy's value, potentially locking funds in the strategy. This is a high-severity issue as it can be triggered by the operator.

#### **[H-04] Controller does not raise an error when there's insufficient liquidity**

**Report Description**:
When a user tries to withdraw tokens from the vault, the vault withdraws tokens from the controller if there's insufficient liquidity in the vault. However, the controller does not raise an error when there's insufficient liquidity in the controller/strategies. This allows MEV searchers to exploit the system by sandwiching withdrawals, causing users to lose their shares while receiving nothing. This is a high-risk issue.

**No match found**.

#### **[H-09] `removeToken` would break the vault/protocol**

**Report Description**:
The `removeToken` function in `Manager.sol` lacks safety checks, which could lock tokens in the original vault. Once the token is removed at the manager contract, the tokens are lost, and the controller's `balanceOf` no longer reflects the real value. This drastically decreases the share price in the vault and could break the entire protocol. This is a high-risk issue.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this specific issue of token removal and its impact on the vault/protocol. The issue is critical as it can break the protocol, but it is not covered in the response list.

#### **[M-08] Controller.inCaseStrategyGetStuck does not update balance**

**Report Description**:
The `Controller.inCaseStrategyGetStuck` function withdraws from a strategy but does not call `updateBalance(_vault, _strategy)` afterward. This results in `_vaultDetails[_vault].balances[_strategy]` not correctly tracking the actual strategy balance, potentially leading to incorrect withdrawal amounts in `Controller.withdraw`.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this specific issue of balance tracking in `inCaseStrategyGetStuck`. The issue is medium-severity as it can lead to incorrect withdrawals, but it is not covered in the response list.

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:
- **[H-01] Controller.setCap sets wrong vault balance**
- **[H-02] setCap breaks vault's Balance**
- **[H-04] Controller does not raise an error when there's insufficient liquidity**
- **[H-09] `removeToken` would break the vault/protocol**
- **[M-08] Controller.inCaseStrategyGetStuck does not update balance**

---

### **Conclusion**
The response list does not adequately address the issues reported in the `issue` list. Several high and medium-severity issues, including incorrect balance handling, insufficient liquidity checks, and token removal vulnerabilities, are entirely missed. The response list focuses on general vulnerabilities like reentrancy and slippage but fails to cover the specific, critical issues identified in the `issue` report.","```

Impact

The v3 vault treats all valid tokens exactly the same. Depositing 1M DAI would get the same share as depositing 1M USDT. User can withdraw their share in another token. Though there's withdrawalProtectionFee (0.1 percent), the vault is still a no slippage stable coin exchange.
Also, I notice that 3crv_token is added to the vault in the test. Treating 3crv_token and all other stable coins the same would make the vault vulnerable to flashloan attack. 3crv_token is an lp token and at the point of writing, the price of it is 1.01. The arbitrage space is about 0.8 percent and makes the vault vulnerable to flashloan attacks.
Though the team may not add crv_token and dai to the same vault, its design makes the vault vulnerable. Strategies need to be designed with super caution or the vault would be vulnerable to attackers.
Given the possibility of a flashloan attack, I consider this a high-risk issue.
  [H-06] earn results in decreasing share price

Impact

For a dai vault that pairs with NativeStrategyCurve3Crv, every time earn() is called, shareholders would lose money. (about 2%)
There are two issues involved. The Vault contract and the controller contract doesn't handle the price difference between the want token and other tokens.
At Vault.sol L293, when a vault calculates its value, it sums up all tokens balance. However, when the controller calculates vaults' value (at Controller.sol L410-L436), it only adds the amount of strategy.want it received. (in this case, it's t3crv).
Under the current design, users who deposit dai to the vault would not get yield. Instead, they would keep losing money. I consider this a high-risk issue
 [H-07] Vault.balance() mixes normalized and standard amounts
Loops
Submitted by cmichel
The Vault.balance function uses the balanceOfThis function which scales (""normalizes"") all balances to 18 decimals.
for (uint8 i; i < _tokens.length; i++) {
    address _token = _tokens[i];
    // everything is padded to 18 decimals
    _balance = _balance.add(_normalizeDecimals(_token, IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this))));
}

Note that balance()'s second term IController(manager.controllers(address(this))).balanceOf() is not normalized. The code is adding a non-normalized amount (for example 6 decimals only for USDC) to a normalized (18 decimals).
 [H-08] Vault.withdraw mixes normalized and standard amounts
 The `Vault.balance` function uses the balanceOfThis function which scales (""normalizes"") all balances to 18 decimals.
for (uint8 i; i < _tokens.length; i++) {
    address _token = _tokens[i];
    // everything is padded to 18 decimals
    _balance = _balance.add(_normalizeDecimals(_token, IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this))));
}

Note that balance()'s second term IController(manager.controllers(address(this))).balanceOf() is not normalized, but it must be.
This leads to many issues through the contracts that use balance but don't treat these values as normalized values. For example, in Vault.withdraw, the computed _amount value is normalized (in 18 decimals). But the uint256 _balance = IERC20(_output).balanceOf(address(this)); value is not normalized but compared to the normalized _amount and even subtracted:
// @audit compares unnormalzied output to normalized output
if (_balance < _amount) {
    IController _controller = IController(manager.controllers(address(this)));
    // @audit cannot directly subtract unnormalized
    uint256 _toWithdraw = _amount.sub(_balance);
    if (_controller.strategies() > 0) {
        _controller.withdraw(_output, _toWithdraw);
    }
    uint256 _after = IERC20(_output).balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 _diff = _after.sub(_balance);
    if (_diff < _toWithdraw) {
        _amount = _balance.add(_diff);
    }
}
 [M-03] Vault.withdraw sometimes burns too many shares

The Vault.withdraw function attempts to withdraw funds from the controller if there are not enough in the vault already. In the case the controller could not withdraw enough, i.e., where _diff < _toWithdraw, the user will receive less output tokens than their fair share would entitle them to (the initial _amount).
if (_diff < _toWithdraw) {
    // @audit burns too many shares for a below fair-share amount
    _amount = _balance.add(_diff);
}

Impact

The withdrawer receives fewer output tokens than they were entitled to.

### **Detailed Analysis**

---

**[H-05] Vault treats all tokens exactly the same that creates (huge) arbitrage opportunities**

**Report Description**:
The v3 vault treats all valid tokens equally, allowing users to deposit one token and withdraw another without accounting for price differences. This creates arbitrage opportunities, especially when LP tokens like 3crv_token are involved. The vault is vulnerable to flashloan attacks due to the price discrepancy of 3crv_token (1.01) compared to stablecoins. The design flaw makes the vault high-risk, even if the team avoids adding certain tokens to the same vault.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue, leaving the vulnerability unacknowledged. The lack of recognition of the arbitrage and flashloan risks is a significant oversight.

---

**[H-06] earn results in decreasing share price**

**Report Description**:
When `earn()` is called in a DAI vault paired with `NativeStrategyCurve3Crv`, shareholders lose approximately 2% of their value. This occurs because the `Vault` and `Controller` contracts fail to handle price differences between the `want` token (t3crv) and other tokens. The `Vault` sums all token balances, while the `Controller` only considers the `want` token. This design flaw results in users losing money instead of earning yield.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue, leaving the design flaw and its financial impact unacknowledged.

---

**[H-07] Vault.balance() mixes normalized and standard amounts**

**Report Description**:
The `Vault.balance` function uses `balanceOfThis`, which normalizes all balances to 18 decimals. However, the second term in `balance()` (`IController(manager.controllers(address(this))).balanceOf()`) is not normalized. This inconsistency leads to incorrect calculations when adding normalized and non-normalized amounts, causing issues throughout the contract.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue, leaving the normalization inconsistency unacknowledged.

---

**[H-08] Vault.withdraw mixes normalized and standard amounts**

**Report Description**:
The `Vault.withdraw` function compares and subtracts normalized and non-normalized amounts, leading to incorrect calculations. For example, the `_amount` value is normalized (18 decimals), but the `_balance` value is not. This inconsistency causes issues in the withdrawal logic, potentially resulting in incorrect token amounts being processed.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue, leaving the normalization inconsistency unacknowledged.

---

**[M-03] Vault.withdraw sometimes burns too many shares**

**Report Description**:
The `Vault.withdraw` function burns too many shares when the controller cannot withdraw enough tokens. In cases where `_diff < _toWithdraw`, the user receives fewer output tokens than their fair share entitles them to, resulting in an unfair loss for the withdrawer.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue, leaving the unfair share burning unacknowledged.

---

### **Conclusion**

The `response_list` provided does not address any of the issues in the `issue` report. All issues remain unacknowledged, leaving significant vulnerabilities and design flaws unaddressed. This represents a critical gap in the response list, as the issues identified in the report are high-risk and require immediate attention.","```

",997,106,"[M-01] VaultHelper deposits don't work with fee-on transfer tokens

Submitted by cmichel, also found by 0xsanson
There are ERC20 tokens that may make certain customizations to their ERC20 contracts. One type of these tokens is deflationary tokens that charge a certain fee for every transfer() or transferFrom(). Others are rebasing tokens that increase in value over time like Aave's aTokens (balanceOf changes over time).
Impact

The VaultHelper's depositVault() and depositMultipleVault functions transfer _amount to this contract using IERC20(_token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);. This could have a fee, and less than _amount ends up in the contract. The next actual vault deposit using IVault(_vault).deposit(_token, _amount); will then try to transfer more than the this contract actually has and will revert the transaction.

Key Audit Priorities:
1. Security is the highest priority, focusing on token transfer safety and external interactions
2. Verify correct implementation of vault and gauge interaction mechanisms
3. Ensure robust input validation and error handling
4. Validate gas efficiency and optimizations
5. Check compliance with token standards and interface specifications

The task list provides a comprehensive approach to auditing the VaultHelper contract, addressing potential vulnerabilities, operational risks, and optimization opportunities.","After analyzing the smart contract code, here's a detailed audit in the requested format:

}

## Additional Security Concerns:

1. **Re-entrancy Risk**: While using SafeERC20 mitigates many ERC20-related issues, the functions follow a pattern where external calls are made after state changes, which is good practice.

2. **Integer Overflow/Underflow**: The contract uses Solidity 0.6.12, which doesn't have built-in overflow protection. SafeERC20 provides some security, but explicit checks may be needed for calculations.

3. **Access Control**: There are no access controls, meaning any user can call these functions. This appears intentional as it's a helper contract.

4. **Approval Race Condition**: The contract correctly handles the ERC20 approval pattern by setting approvals to 0 first, addressing potential issues with certain token implementations.

5. **No Recovery Mechanism**: If tokens are mistakenly sent directly to this contract, there's no way to recover them outside the defined functions.

This contract serves as a convenient wrapper to simplify interactions with vaults and gauges, handling the token flow correctly while maintaining a clear separation of concerns.","I'll analyze the provided issues, consolidate similar ones, and format them according to your requirements.

}",308.13795828819275,37650.0,32.0,"### **[M-01] VaultHelper deposits don't work with fee-on transfer tokens**

**Report Description**:
The `VaultHelper` contract's `depositVault()` and `depositMultipleVault()` functions do not account for fee-on-transfer tokens. These tokens charge a fee during transfers, resulting in less than the specified `_amount` being deposited into the contract. When the contract subsequently attempts to deposit the full `_amount` into the vault, it may revert due to insufficient balance. This issue can also affect rebasing tokens, where the balance changes over time. The impact is that transactions involving such tokens will fail, potentially leading to user frustration and loss of funds.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of fee-on-transfer tokens or rebasing tokens. None of the findings in the response list mention the specific problem of handling tokens that deduct fees during transfers or tokens with dynamic balances. This is a significant oversight, as the issue directly impacts the functionality of the `VaultHelper` contract and its ability to handle certain types of ERC20 tokens.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:
- **[M-01] VaultHelper deposits don't work with fee-on transfer tokens**

---

### **Analysis of Gaps**:
The response list fails to address the issue of fee-on-transfer and rebasing tokens, which is a critical vulnerability in the `VaultHelper` contract. This omission highlights a gap in the analysis, as the issue directly impacts the contract's ability to handle certain types of ERC20 tokens. Future responses should include considerations for fee-on-transfer tokens and rebasing tokens, ensuring that contracts can handle these edge cases effectively.","```

",3492,583,"[M-02] ERC20 return values not checked

Submitted by cmichel, also found by defsec and jonah1005
The ERC20.transfer() and ERC20.transferFrom() functions return a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success. Some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead.
The `Manager.recoverToken` function does not check the return value of this function.
Impact

Tokens that don't actually perform the transfer and return false are still counted as a correct transfer. Furthermore, tokens that do not correctly implement the EIP20 standard, like USDT which does not return a success boolean, will revert.
 [M-09] token -> vault mapping can be overwritten

One vault can have many tokens, but each token should only be assigned to a single vault. The Manager contract keeps a mapping of tokens to vaults in the vaults[_token] => _vault map, and a mapping of vault to tokens in tokens[vault] => token[]. 
The `addToken` function can assign any token to a single vault and allows overwriting an existing vaults[_token] map entry with a different vault. This indirectly disassociates the previous vault for the token. Note that the previous vault's tokens[_previousVault] map still contains the token.
 [M-13] manager.allowedVaults check missing for add/remove strategy

Submitted by 0xRajeev
Impact

The manager.allowedVaults check is missing for add/remove strategy like how it is used in reorderStrategies(). This will allow a strategist to accidentally/maliciously add/remove strategies on unauthorized vaults.
Given the critical access control that is missing on vaults here, this is classified as medium severity.

---

**[M-02] ERC20 return values not checked**

**Report Description**:  
The `ERC20.transfer()` and `ERC20.transferFrom()` functions return a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success. Some tokens do not revert if the transfer fails but return `false` instead. The `Manager.recoverToken` function does not check the return value of these functions.  
**Impact**:  
Tokens that don't actually perform the transfer and return `false` are still counted as a correct transfer. Furthermore, tokens that do not correctly implement the EIP20 standard, like USDT (which does not return a success boolean), will revert.  

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.  

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list is empty and does not address the issue of unchecked ERC20 return values, which is a critical security concern in Solidity smart contracts.  

---

**[M-09] token -> vault mapping can be overwritten**

**Report Description**:  
One vault can have many tokens, but each token should only be assigned to a single vault. The `Manager` contract keeps a mapping of tokens to vaults in the `vaults[_token] => _vault` map and a mapping of vaults to tokens in `tokens[vault] => token[]`. The `addToken` function can assign any token to a single vault and allows overwriting an existing `vaults[_token]` map entry with a different vault. This indirectly disassociates the previous vault for the token. Note that the previous vault's `tokens[_previousVault]` map still contains the token.  

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.  

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of token-to-vault mapping overwrites, which could lead to inconsistencies and potential security vulnerabilities in the contract's state management.  

---

**[M-13] manager.allowedVaults check missing for add/remove strategy**

**Report Description**:  
The `manager.allowedVaults` check is missing for `add/remove strategy` functions, unlike how it is used in `reorderStrategies()`. This will allow a strategist to accidentally or maliciously add/remove strategies on unauthorized vaults.  
**Impact**:  
Given the critical access control that is missing on vaults here, this is classified as medium severity.  

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.  

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the missing access control check for `add/remove strategy` functions, which is a significant oversight in the contract's security design.

### **Conclusion**  
The `response_list` provided is empty and does not address any of the issues in the `issue` report.

- **True Positives**:  
  ```
  None.
  ```

### Steps to Follow:
1. **Identify the ranks at which the true positives appear in the ranked list of predictions**:  
   Since there are no true positives (`None`), there are no ranks to identify.

2. **Calculate the precision at each rank for true positives**:  
   Since there are no true positives, there are no precision values to calculate.

3. **Average the precision values for all true positives**:  
   Since there are no precision values, the average precision is `0`.
