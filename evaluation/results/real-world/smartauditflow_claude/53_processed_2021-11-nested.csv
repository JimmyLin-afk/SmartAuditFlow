",5567,562,"[H-01] Copy your own portfolio to keep earning royalties

Submitted by jayjonah8
Impact

In NestedFactory.sol going through the create() function which leads to the sendFeesWithRoyalties() => addShares() function, Im not seeing any checks preventing someone from copying their own portfolio and receiving royalty shares for it and simply repeating the process over and over again.

[M-01] setReserve() can be front-run

Submitted by palina
Impact

The reserve address variable in NestedFactory.sol remains equal to 0 before the setReserve() function is called by an owner. This may lead to incorrect transfers of tokens or invalid comparison with e.g., the asset reserve (nestedRecords.getAssetReserve(_nftId) == address(reserve)), should they occur before the value for reserve was set. In addition, the immutabiliy of the reserve variable requires extra caution when setting the value.
Proof of Concept

setReserve(): NestedFactory.sol L89
 [M-06] NestedFactory.sol#_submitInOrders() Wrong implementation cause users to be overcharged

Function `_submitInOrders`
When executing orders, the actual amountSpent + feesAmount can be lower than _inputTokenAmount, the unspent amount should be returned to the user.
However, in the current implementation, the unspent amount will be taken as part of the fee. NestedFactory.sol L285-L309
 [M-07] Ensure on-chain that cache is synced

Submitted by GreyArt, also found by WatchPug
Impact

Currently, many core operations (like `NestedFactory.create()`, `NestedFactory.swapTokenForTokens()`) are dependent on the assumption that the cache is synced before these functions are executed however this may not necessarily be the case.
 [M-08] Passing multiple ETH deposits in orders array will use the same msg.value many times

malicious user `msg.value` function `_transferInputTokens`

Contract holdings can be emptied as malicious user will do deposit/withdraw to extract value. This is possible because after transferInputTokens system uses contract balance for user's operations, assuming that equivalent value was transferred.

}

Based on my analysis, this contract is a sophisticated DeFi primitive that allows users to create and manage NFTs representing baskets of tokens. The contract enables various operations like token swaps, additions, and withdrawals while maintaining proper security controls through reentrancy guards, ownership validation, and time locks.

The architecture employs a modular approach with separate contracts for different responsibilities (assets, records, reserve, fee splitting). The operator pattern enables flexibility in supporting different exchanges without modifying the core contract.

While generally well-structured, there are some potential concerns like hardcoded fee calculations, lack of thorough validation in some areas, and questions about the operator trust model that would benefit from further investigation.","I've analyzed the provided list of security issues for the NestedFactory contract and consolidated similar issues. Here's the structured output:

{
  ""Findings"": [
    {
      ""Issue"": ""Improper Operator Removal"",
      ""Severity"": ""Critical"",
      ""Description"": ""The removeOperator function has multiple flaws: it uses 'delete operators[i]' which only sets the element to the default value (0) without actually removing it from the array, leaving gaps. It also has a condition 'i > 0' that prevents removing the first operator at index 0, and lacks proper bounds checking that could lead to out-of-bounds errors."",
      ""Impact"": ""This can lead to array corruption, undefined behavior when accessing operators, increased gas costs due to larger arrays with empty slots, and permanent inability to remove the first operator. If many operators are removed, the contract may experience functional issues when iterating through this corrupted array."",
      ""Location"": ""removeOperator() function""
    },
    {
      ""Issue"": ""Reentrancy Risks in External Calls"",
      ""Severity"": ""High"",
      ""Description"": ""Despite using ReentrancyGuard for public functions, there are potential reentrancy vulnerabilities in several areas: (1) _submitOrder and _safeSubmitOrder make external calls to potentially untrusted operators via callOperator, (2) ETH transfers in _safeTransferAndUnwrap use low-level calls without proper checks-effects-interactions pattern, and (3) some functions like increaseLockTimestamp lack nonReentrant protection entirely."",
      ""Impact"": ""If a malicious operator is added or if the recipient contract has a malicious fallback function, it could perform a reentrancy attack that manipulates contract state between external calls and subsequent operations, potentially draining funds or manipulating the contract state."",
      ""Location"": ""_submitOrder(), _safeSubmitOrder(), _safeTransferAndUnwrap(), increaseLockTimestamp() functions""
    },
    {
      ""Issue"": ""Assertion Usage Instead of Require"",
      ""Severity"": ""High"",
      ""Description"": ""The contract uses 'assert' statements in multiple places (like _submitInOrders and _submitOutOrders) which should be avoided. Assert consumes all remaining gas and reverts the transaction without returning any value or meaningful error message when the condition fails. Using 'require' is preferred for validation."",
      ""Impact"": ""If these assertions fail, users will lose all gas sent with the transaction instead of just the gas consumed up to the failure point. This is particularly problematic in core operational functions handling financial transactions, and may mask critical errors."",

    },
    {
      ""Issue"": ""Fee Calculation Vulnerability"",
      ""Severity"": ""High"",
      ""Description"": ""The _calculateFees function uses a hardcoded 1% fee rate (dividing by 100) without proper checks for edge cases such as small transactions where fees might be rounded down to zero. It also doesn't account for tokens with different decimal configurations, which could lead to inconsistent fee collection."",
      ""Impact"": ""Potential loss of protocol fees, especially for small transactions. This could be exploited to avoid paying fees by splitting transactions into very small amounts. Also, the contract cannot adjust fees based on market conditions without redeployment."",

---

#### **[H-01] Copy your own portfolio to keep earning royalties**

**Report Description**:  
In `NestedFactory.sol`, the `create()` function leads to `sendFeesWithRoyalties()` and `addShares()`. There are no checks preventing users from copying their own portfolio and receiving royalty shares repeatedly, potentially allowing them to exploit the system by repeating this process indefinitely.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of users copying their own portfolios to earn royalties repeatedly. This is a significant oversight in the response list, as it fails to identify a potential economic exploit in the system.

---

#### **[M-01] setReserve() can be front-run**

**Report Description**:  
The `reserve` address variable in `NestedFactory.sol` remains `0` until the `setReserve()` function is called by the owner. This could lead to incorrect token transfers or invalid comparisons (e.g., `nestedRecords.getAssetReserve(_nftId) == address(reserve)`) if they occur before `reserve` is set. Additionally, the immutability of `reserve` requires careful handling during initialization.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Immutable Reserve After Initialization""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response correctly identifies the immutability of the `reserve` address as a concern. However, it does not address the front-running risk or the potential for incorrect comparisons and transfers before `reserve` is set. The response misses critical details about the timing and security implications of setting `reserve`.

---

#### **[M-06] NestedFactory.sol#_submitInOrders() Wrong implementation cause users to be overcharged**

**Report Description**:  
In `_submitInOrders`, the actual `amountSpent + feesAmount` can be lower than `_inputTokenAmount`. The unspent amount should be returned to the user, but the current implementation takes the unspent amount as part of the fee, leading to users being overcharged.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Improper Fee Handling in _handleUnderSpending""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue of improper fee handling, where unspent amounts are incorrectly treated as fees. This aligns with the issue described in the report, as both highlight the risk of users being overcharged due to incorrect fee calculations.

---

#### **[M-07] Ensure on-chain that cache is synced**

**Report Description**:  
Core operations like `NestedFactory.create()` and `NestedFactory.swapTokenForTokens()` depend on the assumption that the cache is synced before execution. However, there is no on-chain mechanism to ensure this, which could lead to incorrect behavior if the cache is not synced.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of cache synchronization. This is a significant gap, as the lack of on-chain validation for cache syncing could lead to critical operational failures.

---

#### **[M-08] Passing multiple ETH deposits in orders array will use the same msg.value many times**

**Report Description**:  
In `_transferInputTokens`, passing multiple ETH deposits in the orders array will use the same `msg.value` multiple times. This could allow a malicious user to deposit/withdraw repeatedly to extract value, as the system uses the contract balance for user operations after `transferInputTokens`, assuming the equivalent value was transferred.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Inconsistent ETH Handling""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies inconsistent ETH handling but does not specifically address the issue of reusing `msg.value` multiple times in the orders array. The response misses the core exploit described in the report, which involves repeated use of the same `msg.value` for multiple deposits.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:

- **[M-06] NestedFactory.sol#_submitInOrders() Wrong implementation cause users to be overcharged**

**Partially Correct Matches**:

- **[M-01] setReserve() can be front-run**
- **[M-08] Passing multiple ETH deposits in orders array will use the same msg.value many times**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:

- **[H-01] Copy your own portfolio to keep earning royalties**
- **[M-07] Ensure on-chain that cache is synced**

---

### **Conclusion**

The response list covers some issues but misses critical vulnerabilities like portfolio copying for royalty exploitation and cache synchronization. Additionally, some responses are partially correct, as they identify related issues but fail to address the specific risks described in the report. Improvements are needed to ensure comprehensive coverage of all identified vulnerabilities.","```
1. Improper Fee Handling in _handleUnderSpending
```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the rank of the true positive**:
   - The true positive is ""Improper Fee Handling in _handleUnderSpending"".
   - This issue appears at rank **8** in the ranked list of predictions.

2. **Calculate the precision at rank 8 (\( P@8 \))**:
   - Precision at rank \( k \) is calculated as the number of true positives up to rank \( k \) divided by \( k \).
   - Up to rank 8, there is **1** true positive.
   - \( P@8 = \frac{1}{8} = 0.125 \).

3. **Compute the Average Precision (AP)**:
   - Since there is only one true positive, the AP is simply the precision at the rank where the true positive appears.
   - \( AP = 0.125 \).

**Output**:
```
0.125

  [M-04] FeeSplitter: Unbounded number of shareholders can cause DOS

Impact

There is no limit to the number of shareholders. It is therefore possible to set a large number of shareholders such that `_sendFees()` will run out of gas when adding shares to each shareholder. This will cause denial of service to all NestedFactory functions, especially the ones that will remove funds like withdraw() and destroy().

Key Observations and Rationale:
1. The task list covers comprehensive audit areas specific to the FeeSplitter contract.
2. Tasks are designed to be specific, actionable, and directly address potential vulnerabilities.
3. The approach considers both technical implementation details and broader contract design considerations.
4. Each area targets a specific aspect of contract security, functionality, and efficiency.

Recommendations for Audit Execution:
- Prioritize security-critical tasks first
- Use a combination of static analysis, manual review, and comprehensive testing
- Implement thorough test cases covering various scenarios
- Consider formal verification for complex calculation methods

      ""Issue"": ""Reentrancy Risk in releaseETH Function"",
      ""Severity"": ""High"",
      ""Description"": ""While the releaseETH function is protected by the nonReentrant modifier, there's still a potential reentrancy vulnerability because it performs an external call to transfer ETH after updating state. Although the function follows the checks-effects-interactions pattern, if the receiving contract is malicious, it could potentially reenter other functions during the ETH transfer."",
      ""Impact"": ""A malicious actor could potentially exploit this to drain funds from the contract by reentering other functions before the transaction completes, potentially receiving more ETH than they're entitled to."",
      ""Location"": ""releaseETH function""
    },
    {
      ""Issue"": ""Integer Overflow/Underflow and Precision Loss in Share Calculation"",
      ""Severity"": ""Medium"",
      ""Description"": ""The _computeShareCount function performs multiplication before division, which could lead to integer overflow if _amount and _weight are large values. Additionally, the function performs integer division which can lead to precision loss, especially with small amounts or when totalWeights is large, resulting in rounding errors."",
      ""Impact"": ""This could result in incorrect share calculations, leading to improper fee distributions. Small shareholders might not receive their proper share of fees if the amounts are too small, and some tokens could remain locked in the contract due to rounding errors with no way to distribute them."",
      ""Location"": ""_computeShareCount function""
    },
    {
      ""Issue"": ""Lack of Address Validation"",
      ""Severity"": ""Medium"",
      ""Description"": ""The setShareholders function and constructor don't validate if any of the _accounts are zero addresses or duplicates. Additionally, the contract does not validate that the _weth address in the constructor is non-zero, which is critical since weth is immutable."",
      ""Impact"": ""Funds could be permanently locked or lost if distributed to invalid addresses. If weth is set to the zero address, the releaseETH functionality would be broken permanently. Duplicate addresses could receive disproportionate amounts of fees."",
      ""Location"": ""setShareholders function, constructor, and _addShareholder function""
    },
    {
      ""Issue"": ""Centralization Risk with Owner Controls"",
      ""Severity"": ""Medium"",
      ""Description"": ""The contract inherits from Ownable and gives the owner significant privileges, including the ability to change shareholders and their weights at any time. This creates a centralization risk where the owner could manipulate fee distributions."",

      ""Description"": ""The contract allows adding shareholders and updating their weights, but there is no mechanism to fully remove a shareholder. A shareholder with 0 weight would still be in the array and processed in loops."",
      ""Impact"": ""Inefficient gas usage over time if shareholders need to be removed, as the contract will still process them in loops, leading to maintenance challenges."",

      ""Issue"": ""Unchecked Return Values and Insufficient Validation"",
      ""Severity"": ""Low"",
      ""Description"": ""While using SafeERC20's safeTransfer which handles failed transfers, there's no explicit handling of edge cases like transfers to contracts that don't properly implement ERC20. Additionally, the releaseETH function uses a low-level call to transfer ETH and while it does check the success boolean, it doesn't handle the returned data."",

#### **[M-02] FeeSplitter: No sanity check to prevent shareholder from being added twice**

**Report Description**:  
The `_sendFee()` function in the `FeeSplitter` contract does not include a sanity check to prevent duplicate shareholders from being added. This oversight allows the same shareholder to be added multiple times, leading to unintended fee distributions where duplicate shareholders receive more than their intended share.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Lack of Address Validation""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the lack of address validation, including the possibility of duplicate addresses, which aligns with the issue. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific risk of duplicate shareholders receiving disproportionate fees or the recommended mitigation step of sorting the `_accounts` array to prevent duplicates. This omission makes the response partially correct.

---

#### **[M-04] FeeSplitter: Unbounded number of shareholders can cause DOS**

**Report Description**:  
The `FeeSplitter` contract does not impose a limit on the number of shareholders. This can lead to a denial of service (DOS) scenario where the `_sendFees()` function runs out of gas when processing a large number of shareholders. This issue affects all functions in the `NestedFactory` contract that involve fund removal, such as `withdraw()` and `destroy()`.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential DoS due to Unbounded Loop""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the risk of unbounded loops causing denial of service, specifically in functions like `_sendFees()`. It correctly highlights the impact of exceeding the block gas limit, which aligns with the issue description. The response fully addresses the vulnerability and its implications.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:

- **[M-04] FeeSplitter: Unbounded number of shareholders can cause DOS**

**Partially Correct Matches**:

- **[M-02] FeeSplitter: No sanity check to prevent shareholder from being added twice**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:

- *None*

### **Overall Assessment**

The `response_list` effectively covers the majority of the issues in the `issue` report, with one partially correct match and one fully correct match. The partially correct match could be improved by explicitly addressing the specific risks of duplicate shareholders and the recommended mitigation steps. Overall, the responses demonstrate a good understanding of the vulnerabilities and their impacts.","```
1. Potential DoS due to Unbounded Loop
```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the rank of the true positive**:
   - The true positive is ""Potential DoS due to Unbounded Loop"".
   - In the ranked list of predictions, this issue appears at rank 5.

2. **Calculate the precision at that rank (P@k)**:
   - Precision at rank 5 is calculated as the number of true positives up to rank 5 divided by 5.
   - Since there is only one true positive up to rank 5, \( P@5 = \frac{1}{5} = 0.2 \).

3. **Compute the Average Precision (AP)**:
   - Since there is only one true positive, the AP is simply the precision at its rank.
   - Therefore, \( AP = 0.2 \).

**Output**:
```
0.2
```"
