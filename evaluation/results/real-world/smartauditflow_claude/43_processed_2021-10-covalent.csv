",5629,477,"[H-01] Usage of an incorrect version of Ownbale library can potentially malfunction all onlyOwner functions

Submitted by WatchPug
DelegatedStaking.sol L62-L63 ```
// this is used to have the contract upgradeable
function initialize(uint128 minStakedRequired) public initializer {
```
Based on the context and comments in the code, the DelegatedStaking.sol contract is designed to be deployed as an upgradeable proxy contract.
However, the current implementation is using an non-upgradeable version of the Ownbale library: @openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol instead of the upgradeable version: @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol.
A regular, non-upgradeable Ownbale library will make the deployer the default owner in the constructor. Due to a requirement of the proxy-based upgradeability system, no constructors can be used in upgradeable contracts. Therefore, there will be no owner when the contract is deployed as a proxy contract.
As a result, all the onlyOwner functions will be inaccessible.
 [H-02] unstake should update exchange rates first

Submitted by cmichel
The unstake function does not immediately update the exchange rates. It first computes the validatorSharesRemove = tokensToShares(amount, v.exchangeRate) with the old exchange rate.
Only afterwards, it updates the exchange rates (if the validator is not disabled):
// @audit shares are computed here with old rate
uint128 validatorSharesRemove = tokensToShares(amount, v.exchangeRate);
require(validatorSharesRemove > 0, ""Unstake amount is too small"");

if (v.disabledEpoch == 0) {
    // @audit rates are updated here
    updateGlobalExchangeRate();
    updateValidator(v);
    // ...
}   [M-01] reward tokens could get lost due to rounding down

The function `depositRewardTokens` divides the ""amount"" of tokens by allocatedTokensPerEpoch to calculate the endEpoch. When ""amount"" isn't a multiple of allocatedTokensPerEpoch the result of the division will be rounded down, effectively losing a number of tokens for the rewards.
For example if allocatedTokensPerEpoch is set to 3e18 and ""amount"" is 100e18 then endEpoch will be increased with 33e18 and the last 1e18 tokens are lost.
A similar problem occurs here:
in setAllocatedTokensPerEpoch(), with the recalculation of endEpoch
in takeOutRewardTokens(), with the retrieval of tokens
in _stake(), when initializing endEpoch (e.g. when endEpoch==0)
Proof of Concept

DelegatedStaking.sol L368-L383

[M-02] Incorrect updateGlobalExchangeRate implementation

Function `_UpdateGlobalExchangeRate` has incorrect implementation when totalGlobalShares is zero.
If any user didn't start stake, totalGlobalShares is 0, and every stake it will increase. but there is possibility that totalGlobalShares can be 0 amount later by unstake or disable validator.
 [M-03] Validator can fail to receive commission reward in redeemAllRewards

Validator can fail to receive commission reward by calling redeemAllRewards. There's a check in redeemAllRewards
uint128 rewards = sharesToTokens(s.shares, v.exchangeRate) - s.staked;
require(rewards > 0, ""Nothing to redeem"");

The validator's tx might be reverted here even if he got some commission reward to receive.

This task list provides a comprehensive and structured approach to auditing the DelegatedStaking contract. It covers critical areas of concern including security, access control, staking mechanisms, external interactions, upgradability, complex logic, gas efficiency, event logging, and error handling.

The tasks are designed to be:
- Relevant to the specific implementation details
- Specific in their scope
- Actionable for an auditor
- Covering multiple dimensions of smart contract security and functionality

      ""Issue"": ""Reentrancy Vulnerabilities in External Transfers"",
      ""Severity"": ""High"",
      ""Description"": ""The contract makes external calls via _transferFromContract() without implementing proper reentrancy guards. State updates are performed after external calls in several functions. While the contract uses SafeERC20, it's still vulnerable if the token contract has callback mechanisms."",

---

#### **[H-01] Usage of an incorrect version of Ownable library can potentially malfunction all onlyOwner functions**

**Report Description**:  
The `DelegatedStaking.sol` contract is designed to be deployed as an upgradeable proxy contract. However, it uses the non-upgradeable version of the `Ownable` library (`@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol`) instead of the upgradeable version (`@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol`). This mismatch means that the contract will not have an owner when deployed as a proxy, rendering all `onlyOwner` functions inaccessible.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**. The response list does not address the issue of using an incorrect version of the `Ownable` library in an upgradeable contract.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not identify or address this issue, which is critical for the functionality of the contract. The use of a non-upgradeable `Ownable` library in an upgradeable contract is a significant oversight that can lead to the inaccessibility of `onlyOwner` functions.

---

#### **[H-02] unstake should update exchange rates first**

**Report Description**:  
The `unstake` function computes `validatorSharesRemove` using the old exchange rate before updating the exchange rates. This can lead to incorrect calculations of shares to be removed, especially if the exchange rate changes after the computation but before the update.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**. The response list does not address the issue of updating exchange rates in the `unstake` function.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not identify or address this issue, which can lead to incorrect calculations and potential vulnerabilities in the staking mechanism.

---

#### **[M-01] reward tokens could get lost due to rounding down**

**Report Description**:  
The `depositRewardTokens` function divides the `amount` by `allocatedTokensPerEpoch` to calculate the `endEpoch`. If `amount` is not a multiple of `allocatedTokensPerEpoch`, the division will round down, resulting in lost tokens. This issue also occurs in `setAllocatedTokensPerEpoch`, `takeOutRewardTokens`, and `_stake`.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Precision Loss in Rate Calculations""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the issue of precision loss in calculations but does not specifically address the loss of reward tokens due to rounding down in the `depositRewardTokens` function and other related functions.

---

#### **[M-02] Incorrect updateGlobalExchangeRate implementation**

**Report Description**:  
The `_updateGlobalExchangeRate` function has an incorrect implementation when `totalGlobalShares` is zero. This can lead to incorrect calculations of exchange rates, especially if `totalGlobalShares` becomes zero due to unstaking or disabling a validator.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential Division by Zero""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the issue of potential division by zero but does not specifically address the incorrect implementation of `_updateGlobalExchangeRate` when `totalGlobalShares` is zero.

---

#### **[M-03] Validator can fail to receive commission reward in redeemAllRewards**

**Report Description**:  
The `redeemAllRewards` function includes a check that requires `rewards > 0`. This check can cause the transaction to revert even if the validator has commission rewards to receive, as the commission rewards are not included in the `rewards` calculation.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**. The response list does not address the issue of validators failing to receive commission rewards in `redeemAllRewards`.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not identify or address this issue, which can lead to validators being unable to receive their commission rewards.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:  
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:  
- **[M-01] reward tokens could get lost due to rounding down**  
- **[M-02] Incorrect updateGlobalExchangeRate implementation**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:  
- **[H-01] Usage of an incorrect version of Ownable library can potentially malfunction all onlyOwner functions**  
- **[H-02] unstake should update exchange rates first**  
- **[M-03] Validator can fail to receive commission reward in redeemAllRewards**

---

### **Conclusion**  
The response list partially addresses some of the issues in the issue report but misses critical vulnerabilities, particularly those related to the incorrect use of the `Ownable` library, the order of operations in the `unstake` function, and the handling of commission rewards in `redeemAllRewards`. These gaps indicate a need for a more comprehensive review of the contract's security and functionality.","```
