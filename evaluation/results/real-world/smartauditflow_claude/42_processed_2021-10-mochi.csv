}",3028.0,374.0,"[H-01] Vault fails to track debt correctly that leads to bad debt
Arithmetic issue in function `borrow`

It's similar to the issue ""misuse amount as increasing debt in the vault contract"". Similar issue in a different place that leads to different exploit patterns and severity.
When users borrow usdm from a vault, the debt increases by the amount * 1.005.
    uint256 increasingDebt = (_amount * 1005) / 1000;

However, when the contract records the total debt it uses _amount instead of increasingDebt.
details[_id].debtIndex =
    (details[_id].debtIndex * (totalDebt)) /
    (details[_id].debt + _amount);
details[_id].debt = totalDebt;
details[_id].status = Status.Active;
debts += _amount;
 [H-05] debts calculation is not accurate

Submitted by gpersoon
Impact

The value of the global variable `debts` in the contract MochiVault.sol is calculated in an inconsistent way.
In the function borrow() the variable debts is increased with a value excluding the fee. However in repay() and liquidate() it is decreased with the same value as details\[\_id].debt is decreased, which is including the fee.
This would mean that debts will end up in a negative value when all debts are repay-ed. Luckily the function repay() prevents this from happening.
In the meantime the value of debts isn't accurate. This value is used directly or indirectly in:
utilizationRatio(), stabilityFee() calculateFeeIndex() of MochiProfileV0.sol
liveDebtIndex(), accrueDebt(), currentDebt() of MochiVault.sol
 [H-08] Anyone can extend withdraw wait period by depositing zero collateral

In MochiVault.sol, the `deposit` function allows anyone to deposit collateral into any position. A malicious user can call this function with amount = 0, which would reset the amount of time the owner has to wait before they can withdraw their collateral from their position. This is especially troublesome with longer delays, as a malicious user would only have to spend a little gas to lock out all other users from being able to withdraw from their positions, compromising the functionality of the contract altogether.

[M-04] Unchecked ERC20 transfer calls

Submitted by loop, also found by cmichel, defsec, gzeon, leastwood, nikitastupin, pants, and WatchPug
ERC20 transfer and transferFrom calls normally return true on a succesful transfer. In DutchAuctionLiquidator the call asset.transfer(msg.sender, _collateral); is made. asset refers to whichever ERC20 asset is used for the vault of that auction. If asset is an ERC20 token which does not comply with the EIP-20 standard it might return false on a failed transaction rather than revert. In this case it would count as a valid transaction even though it is not. If a vault would be making use of USDT the transfer call would always revert as USDT returns void on transfers.
There are a few more transfer(From) calls which are unchecked, these are however all on a predetermined asset (mochi, usdM and crv) and unlikely to cause problems.
 [M-10] griefing attack to block withdraws

Every time you deposit some assets in the vault (via deposit() of MochiVault.sol) then ""lastDeposit[_id]"" is set to block.timestamp. The modifier wait() checks this value and makes sure you cannot withdraw for ""delay()"" blocks. The default value for delay() is 3 minutes.
Knowing this delay you can do a griefing attack: On chains with low gas fees: every 3 minutes deposit a tiny amount for a specific NFT-id (which has a large amount of assets). On chains with high gas fees: monitor the mempool for a withdraw() transaction and frontrun it with a deposit()",5.0,"pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

{
  ""Findings"": [
    {
      ""Issue"": ""Reentrancy vulnerabilities in flashLoan and other functions"",
      ""Severity"": ""High"",
      ""Description"": ""The contract makes external calls before updating state in multiple functions, violating the checks-effects-interactions pattern. The flashLoan function transfers tokens to the receiver before verifying the callback was successful. This creates a potential re-entrancy vulnerability if the receiver is malicious and the token has callbacks. Similarly, the withdraw function transfers assets before completing state updates."",
      ""Impact"": ""An attacker could potentially drain funds by re-entering the contract during the callback or manipulate the contract state in unexpected ways, potentially leading to theft of assets or manipulation of debt positions."",
      ""Location"": ""flashLoan() function (lines 304-314), withdraw() function, and other functions with external calls""
    },
    {
      ""Issue"": ""Missing validation for position ownership in repay function"",
      ""Severity"": ""High"",
      ""Description"": ""The repay function doesn't verify that the caller is the owner of the position or approved to manage it. Unlike other functions like withdraw() or borrow() that check 'require(engine.nft().ownerOf(_id) == msg.sender, \""!approved\"")', the repay function allows anyone to repay debt for any position ID."",
      ""Impact"": ""This could lead to various attack vectors including potential denial of service or economic attacks where an attacker could manipulate a user's position by repaying their debt, potentially triggering unexpected state changes or affecting the user's strategy."",
      ""Location"": ""repay() function (lines 246-264)""
    },
    {
      ""Issue"": ""Insufficient validation in liquidate function"",
      ""Severity"": ""High"",
      ""Description"": ""The liquidate function does not validate that the input parameters (_collateral and _usdm) are within valid bounds or follow proper liquidation ratios. While it checks if a position is liquidatable, it doesn't verify that the amount of collateral taken and debt repaid are proportional to what's required based on the liquidation factor."",
      ""Impact"": ""A malicious liquidator could potentially extract more collateral than entitled or repay less debt than required, leading to financial losses for position owners or the protocol. This could result in exploitation by the liquidator contract to drain value from the vault beyond what should be permissible."",
      ""Location"": ""liquidate() function (lines 266-283)""
    },
    {
      ""Issue"": ""Debt accounting and calculation issues"",
      ""Severity"": ""High"",
      ""Description"": ""Multiple issues with debt calculations exist throughout the contract: 1) In the repay function, when debts < _amount, it sets debts to 0 instead of raising an error, suggesting an accounting error. 2) In the accrueDebt function, complex calculations might lead to precision loss or inconsistencies, especially with the discount mechanism. 3) The contract has a complex debt accounting system with global and per-position tracking that might lead to inconsistencies."",
      ""Impact"": ""Accounting discrepancies could lead to situations where the contract incorrectly tracks debt, potentially allowing users to borrow more than they should or repay less than they owe. This affects the solvency of the protocol and could lead to financial losses for either users or the protocol."",

    {
      ""Issue"": ""Problematic debt cap handling and silently reducing borrow amounts"",
      ""Severity"": ""High"",
      ""Description"": ""The borrow function silently reduces the borrowed amount if it would exceed the maxMinted or creditCap limits, rather than reverting. There's no minimum amount check or slippage protection, which means users might receive significantly less than expected without explicit notification."",
      ""Impact"": ""Users might receive less USDM than expected without clear feedback, potentially causing issues with dependent operations or strategies. This could break composability with other contracts expecting specific amounts and cause unexpected behavior for users or integrating contracts."",

    {
      ""Issue"": ""Inadequate wait period enforcement"",
      ""Severity"": ""High"",
      ""Description"": ""The wait modifier applies a delay before withdrawals but not before borrowing. This allows a user to deposit funds and immediately borrow against them without waiting for the delay period, potentially enabling various attack vectors including price manipulation."",

There's no time-weighted average price check or other manipulation protection mechanisms. Additionally, there's no protection against MEV attacks in liquidations or other price-sensitive operations."",
      ""Impact"": ""An attacker could manipulate price feeds momentarily to force healthy positions into liquidation, allowing them to acquire collateral at discounted rates. Users could receive worse prices or have liquidations triggered unexpectedly due to transaction ordering manipulation."",

    },
    {
      ""Issue"": ""Math precision issues in debt calculations"",
      ""Severity"": ""Medium"",
      ""Description"": ""Multiple instances of potential precision loss in calculations: 1) The borrow function increases debt by a fixed 0.5% (1005/1000) as a fee, but then adjusts the debtIndex using a calculation that doesn't precisely account for this increase. 2) Division before multiplication patterns appear in several places. 3) Complex arithmetic operations in accrueDebt and other functions could potentially result in overflow/underflow errors or precision loss."",
      ""Impact"": ""Accumulated rounding errors could lead to discrepancies between actual debt and recorded debt. Small borrowers might pay disproportionate fees due to rounding errors. In extreme cases, system could freeze if calculations consistently revert due to overflow/underflow in extreme market conditions."",
      ""Location"": ""borrow() function (lines 211-213), accrueDebt() function, and other calculation-heavy functions""

      ""Severity"": ""Medium"",
      ""Description"": ""The accrueDebt function is called as a modifier in many functions and performs complex calculations every time, including when processing a specific position. For positions with significant history or during periods of high volatility, this could lead to excessive gas consumption."",

      ""Issue"": ""Unchecked return values of token transfers"",
      ""Severity"": ""Medium"",
      ""Description"": ""The contract uses cheapTransfer and cheapTransferFrom from the CheapERC20 library which might not check return values for certain tokens, assuming they revert on failure. However, not all ERC20 tokens behave this way, and some might return false instead of reverting. Similarly, the contract doesn't check the return values of mint calls to the engine.minter() and engine.nft() components."",
      ""Impact"": ""Failed transfers or mints might not be detected, potentially leading to loss of funds or incorrect state updates. If the underlying asset token has non-standard behavior or doesn't properly implement ERC20 standard, transfers could fail silently."",

#### **[H-01] Vault fails to track debt correctly that leads to bad debt**

**Report Description**:  
The `borrow` function in the vault contract incorrectly calculates debt. When users borrow `usdm`, the debt increases by `_amount * 1.005`, but the total debt is recorded using `_amount` instead of `increasingDebt`. This inconsistency leads to incorrect debt tracking, potentially causing bad debt and financial discrepancies.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Debt accounting and calculation issues""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue with debt calculations in the `borrow` function. It highlights the potential for accounting discrepancies and financial losses, which aligns with the reported issue. The response also mentions precision loss and inconsistencies in debt tracking, which are relevant to the reported problem.

---

#### **[H-05] `debts` calculation is not accurate**

**Report Description**:  
The global variable `debts` in `MochiVault.sol` is calculated inconsistently. In the `borrow` function, `debts` is increased by a value excluding the fee, while in `repay` and `liquidate`, it is decreased by a value including the fee. This inconsistency could lead to `debts` becoming negative when all debts are repaid, although the `repay` function prevents this. The inaccurate `debts` value affects multiple functions that rely on it.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Debt accounting and calculation issues""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response correctly identifies the issue with debt calculations and mentions the potential for accounting discrepancies. It also highlights the impact on the protocol's solvency and financial losses, which aligns with the reported issue.

---

#### **[H-08] Anyone can extend withdraw wait period by depositing zero collateral**

**Report Description**:  
The `deposit` function in `MochiVault.sol` allows anyone to deposit collateral into any position, even with `amount = 0`. This resets the `lastDeposit[_id]` timestamp, extending the wait period for withdrawals. A malicious user could exploit this to lock out other users from withdrawing their collateral, compromising the contract's functionality.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Missing input validation""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the lack of input validation in the `deposit` function but does not specifically mention the exploit of resetting the withdrawal wait period. The impact of this issue is more severe than just ""wasting gas,"" as it can disrupt the contract's functionality.

---

#### **[M-04] Unchecked ERC20 transfer calls**

**Report Description**:  
The `DutchAuctionLiquidator` contract does not check the return value of `asset.transfer(msg.sender, _collateral)`. If the `asset` is a non-standard ERC20 token (e.g., USDT) that returns `false` instead of reverting on failure, the transfer could fail silently, leading to incorrect state updates and potential loss of funds.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Unchecked return values of token transfers""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue with unchecked ERC20 transfer calls and explains the potential impact of silent failures. It also mentions the risk of non-standard ERC20 tokens, which aligns with the reported issue.

---

#### **[M-10] Griefing attack to block withdraws**

**Report Description**:  
The `deposit` function in `MochiVault.sol` updates the `lastDeposit[_id]` timestamp, which is used by the `wait` modifier to enforce a withdrawal delay. A malicious user can exploit this by depositing a tiny amount every 3 minutes (or frontrunning `withdraw` transactions) to block withdrawals for specific positions, especially on chains with low gas fees.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Inadequate wait period enforcement""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response mentions the `wait` modifier and its enforcement but does not specifically address the griefing attack vector described in the issue. The impact of this issue is more severe than just ""allowing immediate borrowing,"" as it can disrupt the contract's functionality.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:

- **[H-01] Vault fails to track debt correctly that leads to bad debt**
- **[H-05] `debts` calculation is not accurate**
- **[M-04] Unchecked ERC20 transfer calls**

**Partially Correct Matches**:

- **[H-08] Anyone can extend withdraw wait period by depositing zero collateral**
- **[M-10] Griefing attack to block withdraws**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:

- *None*

### **Conclusion**

The `response_list` covers most of the issues in the `issue` report, with some responses being **correct** and others **partially correct**. The partially correct responses miss specific exploit vectors or underestimate the severity of the issues. Overall, the `response_list` provides a good overview of the vulnerabilities but could benefit from more detailed analysis of certain exploit scenarios.",3,2,0,16,"```

Submitted by WatchPug
`distributeMochi()` will call _buyMochi() to convert mochiShare to Mochi token and call _shareMochi() to send Mochi to vMochi Vault and veCRV Holders. It wont touch the treasuryShare.
However, in the current implementation, treasuryShare will be reset to 0. This is unexpected and will cause the protocol fee can not be properly accounted for and collected.

Function `_shareMochi()`  overwritten `treasuryShare`
The FeePoolV0.sol contract accrues fees upon the liquidation of undercollaterised positions. These fees are split between treasury and vMochi contracts. However, when `distributeMochi()` is called to distribute mochi tokens to veCRV holders, both mochiShare and treasuryShare is flushed from the contract when there are still usdm tokens in the contract.
 [H-12] feePool is vulnerable to sandwich attack.

There's a permissionless function `distributeMochi` in FeePoolV0.sol L55-L62. Since everyone can trigger this function, an attacker can launch a sandwich attack with flashloan to steal the funds.
The devs have mentioned this concern in the comment. An attacker can steal the funds with a flash loan attack.

**Report Description**:
The `distributeMochi()` function in `FeePoolV0.sol` calls `_buyMochi()` to convert `mochiShare` to Mochi tokens and `_shareMochi()` to distribute Mochi tokens to the vMochi Vault and veCRV Holders. However, the `_shareMochi()` function unexpectedly resets `treasuryShare` to `0`, even though it should not touch `treasuryShare`. This behavior causes the protocol fee to be improperly accounted for and collected, leading to potential financial discrepancies in the protocol.

The `_shareMochi()` function in `FeePoolV0.sol` overwrites `treasuryShare` by setting it to `0` when distributing Mochi tokens to vMochi Vault and veCRV Holders. This behavior is unexpected and incorrect, as `treasuryShare` should not be reset during this process. This issue can lead to the protocol fee being improperly accounted for and collected, especially when there are still `usdm` tokens in the contract.

### **[H-12] FeePool is vulnerable to sandwich attack**

**Report Description**:
The `distributeMochi()` function in `FeePoolV0.sol` is permissionless, meaning anyone can trigger it. This makes the contract vulnerable to a sandwich attack, where an attacker can use a flash loan to manipulate the distribution of Mochi tokens and steal funds from the pool. The developers have acknowledged this concern in the comments, but the issue remains unaddressed. This is a high-risk issue as attackers can potentially steal all the funds in the pool.

#### **[H-03] ReferralFeePoolV0.sol#claimRewardAsMochi() Array out of bound exception**

**Report Description**:  
In the `claimRewardAsMochi` function, the `path` array is initialized with a length of 2 but is assigned 3 elements (indices 0, 1, and 2). This results in an out-of-bounds exception at runtime, causing the transaction to revert. This issue renders the function unusable and locks user rewards in the contract.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Array Out of Bounds in Path Initialization""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the array out-of-bounds issue in the `claimRewardAsMochi` function. It correctly describes the initialization error and its impact, which aligns with the issue report. The severity and location are also accurately identified.

---

#### **[H-06] Referrer can drain ReferralFeePoolV0**

**Report Description**:  
The `claimRewardAsMochi` function does not reset the user's reward balance (`reward[msg.sender]`) after claiming. This allows users to repeatedly claim the same reward, potentially draining the contract's funds.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Missing Reward Reset After Claiming""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response correctly identifies the issue of missing reward balance reset in the `claimRewardAsMochi` function. It accurately describes the impact of this oversight, including the potential for repeated claims and fund drainage. The severity and location are also correctly specified.

---

#### **[M-02] ReferralFeePool is vulnerable to MEV searcher**

**Report Description**:  
The `claimRewardAsMochi` function ignores slippage control in the `swapExactTokensForTokens` call, setting the minimum output amount to 1. This makes the swap vulnerable to MEV attacks, such as sandwiching, which could result in significant value loss for users.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Insufficient Slippage Protection""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the lack of slippage protection in the `swapExactTokensForTokens` call. It correctly describes the vulnerability to MEV attacks and the potential impact on users. The severity and location are also appropriately identified.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:

- **[H-03] ReferralFeePoolV0.sol#claimRewardAsMochi() Array out of bound exception**
- **[H-06] Referrer can drain ReferralFeePoolV0**

### **Conclusion**  
All issues in the `issue` report are correctly matched and addressed in the `response_list`. The responses accurately describe the vulnerabilities, their impacts, and their locations, aligning with Solidity best practices and security standards. No gaps or partially correct matches were identified.",0,0,3,0,"1. Array Out of Bounds in Path Initialization  
2. Missing Reward Reset After Claiming  
3. Insufficient Slippage Protection","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the ranks of the true positives in the ranked list of predictions**:
   - ""Array Out of Bounds in Path Initialization"" appears at rank 1.
   - ""Missing Reward Reset After Claiming"" appears at rank 2.
   - ""Insufficient Slippage Protection"" appears at rank 4.

2. **Calculate the precision at each rank where a true positive appears**:

Impact

Everyone can call the function `registerAsset()` of MochiProfileV0.sol Assuming the liquidity for the asset is sufficient, `registerAsset()` will reset the _assetClass of an already registered asset to AssetClass.Sigma.
When the _assetClass is changed to AssetClass.Sigma then liquidationFactor(), riskFactor(), maxCollateralFactor(), liquidationFee() keeperFee() maxFee() will also return a different value. Then the entire vault will behave differently. The threshold for liquidation will also be different, possibly leading to a liquidation that isn't supposed to happen.",1.0,"pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

**Report Description**:  
The `registerAsset()` function in `MochiProfileV0.sol` allows any user to register an asset, assuming the liquidity requirement is met. This function can overwrite the `_assetClass` value of an already registered asset to `AssetClass.Sigma`. Changing the `_assetClass` affects critical functions such as `liquidationFactor()`, `riskFactor()`, `maxCollateralFactor()`, `liquidationFee()`, `keeperFee()`, and `maxFee()`. This can lead to unintended behavior in the vault, including incorrect liquidation thresholds, potentially causing unintended liquidations.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Unrestricted Asset Registration Vulnerability""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the issue of unrestricted asset registration and its potential for misuse by malicious actors. However, it focuses on the inconsistency caused by the lack of associated vaults and does not address the critical risk of overwriting the `_assetClass` value and its downstream impacts on vault behavior and liquidation thresholds. While the response captures the broader issue of unrestricted registration, it misses the specific vulnerability described in the report.

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:  
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:  
- **[H-04] registerAsset() can overwrite _assetClass value**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:  
- *None*

### **Analysis of Gaps**  
The response list partially addresses the issue but fails to fully capture the specific risk of overwriting the `_assetClass` value and its impact on vault behavior. This gap highlights the need for more detailed analysis of the downstream effects of unrestricted asset registration in future responses.",0,0,1,0,"```

**Report Description**:  
The `veCRVlock` function in `MochiTreasury` is permissionless, allowing anyone to trigger it. This makes the treasury vulnerable to a sandwich attack, where an attacker can use flash loans to manipulate the price of tokens before and after the function call, potentially stealing funds from the treasury. This is a high-risk issue as it could result in the loss of all funds in the treasury.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Lack of Slippage Protection in Token Swaps""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the risk of sandwich attacks in the context of token swaps due to the lack of slippage protection in the `_buyCRV` function. However, it does not directly address the vulnerability in the `veCRVlock` function, which is the core issue here. While both involve sandwich attacks, the response misses the specific risk posed by the permissionless nature of `veCRVlock`. Thus, it partially covers the issue but does not fully address the described vulnerability.

---

### **[M-14] MochiTreasuryV0.withdrawLock() Is Callable When Locking Has Been Toggled**

**Report Description**:  
The `withdrawLock()` function in `MochiTreasuryV0` does not prevent users from calling it when locking has been toggled. This could lead to unexpected withdrawals, potentially disrupting the intended locking mechanism and causing financial inconsistencies.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Missing Access Control on Critical Functions""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the lack of access control on critical functions, including `withdrawLock()`. It explains the risks associated with unauthorized access to these functions, which aligns with the issue described. The response fully covers the vulnerability and its potential impact.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:

- **[M-14] MochiTreasuryV0.withdrawLock() Is Callable When Locking Has Been Toggled**

**Partially Correct Matches**:

- **[H-09] Treasury is vulnerable to sandwich attack**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:

- *None*

---

### **Analysis of Gaps**

While the response list covers many critical issues, it partially misses the specific vulnerability in the `veCRVlock` function. The response focuses on sandwich attacks in token swaps but does not address the permissionless nature of `veCRVlock`, which is a distinct and high-risk issue. This gap highlights the need for a more detailed analysis of individual functions and their specific vulnerabilities.",1,1,0,14,"```
1. Missing Access Control on Critical Functions
```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the rank of the true positive**:
   - The true positive is ""Missing Access Control on Critical Functions"".
   - This issue appears at rank 1 in the ranked list of predictions.

2. **Calculate the precision at that rank**:
   - Precision at rank 1 (\( P@1 \)) is calculated as the number of true positives up to rank 1 divided by the rank itself.
   - \( P@1 = \frac{1}{1} = 1.0 \)

3. **Compute the Average Precision (AP)**:
   - Since there is only one true positive, the AP is simply the precision at the rank where the true positive appears.
   - \( AP = 1.0 \)

**Output**:

**Report Description**:  
The `MochiEngine` contract allows the operator to change the NFT contract (lines 91-93). If the NFT contract is changed, all vaults would point to a different NFT address, rendering users unable to access their positions. This could break the entire protocol. The existence of such a function is considered high-risk, as it introduces a single point of failure that could disrupt the system entirely.

**Match in Response List**:  
No exact match found. However, the issue is somewhat related to the findings titled **""Lack of Input Validation in Change Functions""** and **""Single Point of Failure in Governance""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**.  
- The **""Lack of Input Validation in Change Functions""** response highlights the risks of changing critical addresses without validation, which aligns with the issue of changing the NFT contract. However, it does not specifically address the impact of changing the NFT contract on vaults and user positions.  
- The **""Single Point of Failure in Governance""** response discusses the risks of a single governance address having complete control, which is relevant but does not directly address the specific issue of changing the NFT contract.  

While these responses touch on related risks, they do not fully capture the specific vulnerability and impact described in the issue report. Therefore, the match is **partially correct**.

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:

**Partially Correct Matches**:  
- **[H-10] Changing NFT contract in the MochiEngine would break the protocol**  

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:

}",586.0,72.0,"[H-13] Tokens Can Be Stolen By Frontrunning VestedRewardPool.vest() and VestedRewardPool.lock()
The VestedRewardPool.sol contract is a public facing contract aimed at vesting tokens for a minimum of 90 days before allowing the recipient to withdraw their mochi. The vest() function does not utilise safeTransferFrom() to ensure that vested tokens are correctly allocated to the recipient. As a result, it is possible to frontrun a call to vest() and effectively steal a recipient's vested tokens. The same issue applies to the lock() function.

After reviewing the VestedRewardPool contract, I've identified several security concerns that should be addressed:

1. **Reentrancy risk**: The `vest()` function determines the amount to vest based on the contract's balance before updating state. This could be exploited if reentrancy is possible through the MOCHI token's transfer functions.

2. **Missing access control**: There's no restriction on who can call `vest()`, allowing anyone to vest tokens for any address.

3. **Missing input validation**: Several functions don't validate inputs properly:
   - `vest()` doesn't check if there are actually new tokens to vest
   - `lock()` and `forceClaim()` don't verify if the user has enough vested tokens

4. **Arithmetic precision issues**: 
   - The weighted average calculation in `vest()` may lose precision
   - Integer division in `forceClaim()` could result in odd wei being lost

5. **Token transfer failure handling**: No checks for successful token transfers in `claim()` and `forceClaim()`.

I would recommend implementing proper access controls, adding checks for token transfer success, validating inputs thoroughly, and protecting against reentrancy attacks.","I've processed the provided set of findings and consolidated similar issues from the VestedRewardPool contract analysis. Here's the condensed report:

{
  ""Findings"": [
    {
      ""Issue"": ""Lack of access control on vest function"",
      ""Severity"": ""Critical"",
      ""Description"": ""The vest function is externally callable by anyone without restrictions. This allows any address to trigger vesting of the contract's Mochi tokens to any recipient, which is likely not the intended design. There's no onlyOwner or similar modifier to restrict who can call this function."",
      ""Impact"": ""Unauthorized users could vest tokens to arbitrary addresses, potentially stealing or redirecting funds intended for legitimate recipients. This could disrupt carefully planned token distribution schedules."",
      ""Location"": ""vest() function""
    },
    {
      ""Issue"": ""Inaccurate token accounting in forceClaim"",
      ""Severity"": ""High"",
      ""Description"": ""The forceClaim function transfers _amount/2 to both the user and vMochi, but subtracts the full _amount from the user's vested balance and from mochiUnderManagement. This creates an accounting error where the contract loses track of half the tokens being claimed. Additionally, there's no validation that _amount is less than or equal to the user's vested balance before performing operations."",
      ""Impact"": ""This accounting error will make the contract's internal state inconsistent with the actual token balances, leading to potential fund loss or contract locking as the mochiUnderManagement value becomes increasingly incorrect. Users could potentially claim more tokens than they have vested."",
      ""Location"": ""forceClaim() function""
    },
    {
      ""Issue"": ""Weightage calculation vulnerability in vest function"",
      ""Severity"": ""High"",
      ""Description"": ""The weighted end time calculation in the vest function has multiple issues: 1) When vesting[_recipient].vested is initially zero, it uses solely the new amount and timestamp, which is correct. 2) However, in subsequent vests, the formula can lead to incorrect vesting periods, especially if large amounts are vested after small initial amounts. 3) There's no validation that the calculated weightedEnd is in the future, which could lead to immediate vesting under certain conditions. 4) Potential division by zero if both vesting[_recipient].vested and amount are zero."",
      ""Impact"": ""Recipients could potentially have shorter vesting periods than intended, allowing them to claim tokens earlier than the protocol design intends. This undermines the token distribution model and economic incentives. Transactions might also revert due to division by zero in edge cases."",
      ""Location"": ""vest() function, weightedEnd calculation""
    },
    {
      ""Issue"": ""Potential reentrancy risk in state-changing functions"",
      ""Severity"": ""High"",
      ""Description"": ""The claim, forceClaim, and lock functions make external calls (mochi.transfer, vMochi.depositFor) before updating the contract's state. While standard ERC20 implementations should not allow reentrancy, nonstandard tokens or future token upgrades could potentially introduce reentrancy vulnerabilities. This violates the checks-effects-interactions pattern."",
      ""Impact"": ""In case of a non-standard or malicious token, this could potentially allow double-claiming of tokens or other unexpected behavior. An attacker could reenter these functions multiple times before state updates occur, potentially draining funds."",
      ""Location"": ""claim(), forceClaim(), and lock() functions""

    {
      ""Issue"": ""Integer overflow in weightedEnd calculation"",
      ""Severity"": ""Medium"",
      ""Description"": ""Though Solidity 0.8.0+ has built-in overflow protection, the calculation of weightedEnd involves multiplying potentially large numbers (vesting[_recipient].vested * vesting[_recipient].ends and amount * (block.timestamp + 90 days)) which could exceed the uint256 limit before the division occurs."",
      ""Impact"": ""This could cause the transaction to revert unexpectedly, especially for accounts with large vesting amounts or far future end dates, leading to denial of service."",
      ""Location"": ""vest function, weightedEnd calculation""
    },
    {
      ""Issue"": ""Lock function insufficient validation"",
      ""Severity"": ""Medium"",
      ""Description"": ""The lock function requires that the vMochi lock period be at least 90 days from the current time, but it doesn't verify that the user has sufficient vested tokens before attempting the operation. While it will eventually revert on underflow when subtracting _amount from vesting[msg.sender].vested, explicit validation would be clearer and prevent unnecessary operations. Additionally, the function approves tokens before checking the lock time condition."",
      ""Impact"": ""While this will eventually fail safely due to underflow checks in Solidity 0.8.0+, it represents poor contract design and could cause confusion or unintended behavior in integrations. The approval remains even if the subsequent depositFor call reverts due to the lock time check, potentially leaving unused approvals that could be exploited later."",
      ""Location"": ""lock() function""
    },
    {
      ""Issue"": ""Integer division rounding in forceClaim"",
      ""Severity"": ""Medium"",
      ""Description"": ""When _amount is odd, the integer division in forceClaim (_amount/2) will round down, resulting in a loss of 1 wei of tokens that remains in the contract but is unaccounted for in mochiUnderManagement."",
      ""Impact"": ""Over time, this could lead to small amounts of tokens becoming permanently locked in the contract due to accounting discrepancies. For every odd-numbered _amount claimed via forceClaim, one token will be left in the contract but no longer accounted for."",
      ""Location"": ""forceClaim() function""
    },

      ""Issue"": ""Inconsistent token handling in claim function"",
      ""Severity"": ""Medium"",
      ""Description"": ""The claim function transfers tokens before updating the mochiUnderManagement value. If the transfer fails (e.g., due to a token contract issue), the state will remain unchanged, which is correct. However, for consistency with other functions and better practice, state changes should happen after confirming external calls succeed."",
      ""Impact"": ""While this issue doesn't directly cause a vulnerability in this contract due to how ERC20 transfers work, it represents an inconsistency in the contract design that could introduce bugs in future modifications."",
      ""Location"": ""claim() function""
    },
    {
      ""Issue"": ""No validation for zero-amount operations"",
      ""Severity"": ""Low"",
      ""Description"": ""The contract does not check if _amount is greater than 0 in the lock and forceClaim functions, allowing users to perform zero-amount operations that would waste gas and potentially update state unnecessarily."",
      ""Impact"": ""Users could waste gas on meaningless transactions, and contract state changes might occur unnecessarily for zero-amount operations."",

      ""Issue"": ""Missing events for important state changes"",
      ""Severity"": ""Low"",

**Report Description**:
The `VestedRewardPool.sol` contract is a public-facing contract designed to vest tokens for a minimum of 90 days before allowing recipients to withdraw their `mochi`. The `vest()` function does not utilize `safeTransferFrom()` to ensure that vested tokens are correctly allocated to the recipient. As a result, it is possible to frontrun a call to `vest()` and effectively steal a recipient's vested tokens. The same issue applies to the `lock()` function.

**Match in Response List**:
No match found.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the specific issue of frontrunning attacks due to the lack of `safeTransferFrom()` in the `vest()` and `lock()` functions. While the response list includes issues related to access control, token accounting, and reentrancy, it does not cover the vulnerability of token theft through frontrunning. This is a critical oversight, as the described issue directly impacts the security and integrity of the token vesting mechanism.
