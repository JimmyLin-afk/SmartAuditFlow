}",2900,449,"[H-01] Minting and burning synths exposes users to unlimited slippage
 function `mintSynth()`
The amount of synths minted / assets received when minting or burning synths can be manipulated to an unlimited extent by manipulating the reserves of the pool
 Proof of Concept

See VaderPool.mintSynth: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-vader/blob/607d2b9e253d59c782e921bfc2951184d3f65825/contracts/dex-v2/pool/VaderPoolV2.sol#L126-L167
Here a user sends nativeDeposit to the pool and the equivalent amount of foreignAsset is minted as a synth to be sent to the user. However the user can't specify the minimum amount of synth that they would accept. A frontrunner can then manipulate the reserves of the pool in order to make foreignAsset appear more valuable than it really is so the user receives synths which are worth much less than what nativeDeposit is worth. This is equivalent to a swap without a slippage limit.
Burning synths essentially runs the same process in behalf so manipulating the pool in the opposite direction will result in the user getting fewer of nativeAsset than they expect.
  [H-02] Redemption value of synths can be manipulated to drain VaderPool of all native assets
 function `mintSynth()`
Draining of funds from VaderPool
 See the VaderPool.mintSynth function: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-vader/blob/607d2b9e253d59c782e921bfc2951184d3f65825/contracts/dex-v2/pool/VaderPoolV2.sol#L126-L167
As the pool's reserves can be manipulated through flashloans similar to on UniswapV2, an attacker may set the exchange rate between nativeAsset and synths (calculated from the reserves). An attacker can exploit this to drain funds from the pool.
The attacker first flashloans and sells a huge amount of foreignAsset to the pool. The pool now thinks nativeAsset is extremely valuable.
The attacker now uses a relatively small amount of nativeAsset to mint synths using VaderPool.mintSynth. As the pool thinks nativeAsset is very valuable the attacker will receive a huge amount of synths.
The attacker can now manipulate the pool in the opposite direction by buying up the foreignAsset they sold to the pool. nativeAsset is now back at its normal price, or perhaps artificially low if the attacker wishes.
The attacker now burns all of their synths. As nativeAsset is considered much less valuable than at the point the synths were minted it takes a lot more of nativeAsset in order to pay out for the burned synths.
For the price of a flashloan and some swap fees, the attacker has now managed to extract a large amount of nativeAsset from the pool. This process can be repeated as long as it is profitable.
 
[H-05] LPs of VaderPoolV2 can manipulate pool reserves to extract funds from the reserve.

Impermanent loss protection can be exploited to drain the reserve.

These losses are then refunded to the LP in VADER tokens from the reserve. NOTE: This IL protection is paid for ALL token pairs. THIS IS IMPORTANT!
 [H-07] VaderReserve does not support paying IL protection out to more than one address, resulting in locked funds

Submitted by TomFrenchBlockchain
Impact

All liquidity deployed to one of VaderPool or VaderPoolV2 will be locked permanently.
Proof of Concept

Both VaderRouter and VaderRouterV2 make calls to VaderReserve in order to pay out IL protection.
 [H-13] Anyone Can Arbitrarily Mint Synthetic Assets In VaderPoolV2.mintSynth()


The mintSynth() function is callable by any user and creates a synthetic asset against foreignAsset if it does not already exist. The protocol expects a user to first approve the contract as a spender before calling mintSynth(). However, any arbitrary user could monitor the blockchain for contract approvals that match VaderPoolV2.sol and effectively frontrun their call to mintSynth() by setting the to argument to their own address. As a result, the nativeDeposit amount is transferred from the victim, and a synthetic asset is minted and finally transferred to the malicious user who is represented by the to address.
 [H-14] Anyone Can Arbitrarily Mint Fungible Tokens In VaderPoolV2.mintFungible()


The mintFungible() function is callable by any user that wishes to mint liquidity pool fungible tokens. The protocol expects a user to first approve the contract as a spender before calling mintFungible(). However, any arbitrary user could monitor the blockchain for contract approvals that match VaderPoolV2.sol and effectively frontrun their call to mintFungible() by setting the to argument to their own address. As a result, the nativeDeposit and foreignDeposit amounts are transferred from the victim, and LP tokens are minted and finally transferred to the malicious user who is represented by the to address.
  [H-21] Lack of access control allow attacker to mintFungible() and mintSynth() with other user's wallet balance
 [H-22] mintSynth() and burnSynth() can be front run
  [H-29] VaderPoolV2.mintFungible exposes users to unlimited slippage

Frontrunners can extract up to 100% of the value provided by LPs to VaderPoolV2.
Proof of Concept

Users can provide liquidity to VaderPoolV2 through the mintFungible function.
https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-vader/blob/429970427b4dc65e37808d7116b9de27e395ce0c/contracts/dex-v2/pool/VaderPoolV2.sol#L271-L335
This allows users to provide tokens in any ratio and the pool will calculate what fraction of the value in the pool this makes up and mint the corresponding amount of liquidity units as an ERC20.
However there's no way for users to specify the minimum number of liquidity units they will accept. As the number of liquidity units minted is calculated from the current reserves, this allows frontrunners to manipulate the pool's reserves in such a way that the LP receives fewer liquidity units than they should. e.g. LP provides a lot of nativeAsset but very little foreignAsset, the frontrunner can then sell a lot of nativeAsset to the pool to devalue it.

This audit reveals that VaderPoolV2 is a sophisticated DEX liquidity pool implementation with several integrated features including:

1. A synthetic asset system that allows users to mint synthetic tokens representing foreign assets
2. Both fungible and non-fungible liquidity position management
3. Impermanent loss protection mechanism that scales with position age
4. Price oracle functionality through cumulative price tracking
5. Owner-controlled token support and queue management

The contract implements several security features including reentrancy protection and role-based access control, though a more detailed review of the inherited contracts would be necessary to fully assess its security posture.","I've analyzed the list of issues provided and consolidated similar ones while maintaining the key information.

#### **[H-01] Minting and burning synths exposes users to unlimited slippage**

**Report Description**:  
The `mintSynth()` and `burnSynth()` functions in `VaderPoolV2` do not allow users to specify a minimum amount of synths or assets they will accept. This lack of slippage protection enables frontrunners to manipulate the pool's reserves, resulting in users receiving fewer tokens than expected. This is equivalent to a swap without a slippage limit, exposing users to significant financial losses.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Lack of slippage protection in swap operations""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue of missing slippage protection in `mintSynth` and `burnSynth` functions. It correctly explains the risks of front-running and MEV attacks, which aligns with the issue report.

---

#### **[H-02] Redemption value of synths can be manipulated to drain VaderPool of all native assets**

**Report Description**:  
An attacker can manipulate the pool's reserves through flashloans to drain funds from `VaderPool`. By artificially inflating the value of `nativeAsset`, the attacker can mint a large amount of synths and then burn them when the value of `nativeAsset` is artificially low, extracting significant amounts of `nativeAsset` from the pool.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Reserves imbalance in mintSynth and burnSynth""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the issue of reserve imbalance but does not explicitly mention the flashloan attack vector or the potential for draining the pool. The impact is described in a more general manner, missing the specific exploit described in the issue report.

---

#### **[H-05] LPs of VaderPoolV2 can manipulate pool reserves to extract funds from the reserve**

**Report Description**:  
Liquidity providers (LPs) can exploit impermanent loss protection to drain the reserve. The `burn` function calculates losses and refunds them in VADER tokens from the reserve, which can be manipulated to extract funds.

**Match in Response List**:  
No match found.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The specific exploit involving impermanent loss protection and reserve draining is not covered.

---

#### **[H-06] Paying IL protection for all VaderPool pairs allows the reserve to be drained**

**Report Description**:  
Impermanent loss (IL) protection is paid for all token pairs, which can be exploited to drain the Vader Reserve. The `burn` function calculates losses and refunds them in VADER tokens, allowing attackers to manipulate the system.

**Match in Response List**:  
No match found.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The specific exploit involving IL protection for all token pairs is not covered.

---

#### **[H-07] VaderReserve does not support paying IL protection out to more than one address, resulting in locked funds**

**Report Description**:  
The `VaderReserve` does not support paying IL protection to multiple addresses, leading to permanently locked funds for liquidity deployed to `VaderPool` or `VaderPoolV2`.

**Match in Response List**:  
No match found.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The specific problem of locked funds due to IL protection limitations is not covered.

---

#### **[H-13] Anyone Can Arbitrarily Mint Synthetic Assets In VaderPoolV2.mintSynth()**

**Report Description**:  
The `mintSynth()` function is callable by any user and does not validate the `to` address. An attacker can frontrun a victim's transaction and mint synthetic assets to their own address, stealing the victim's `nativeDeposit`.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Lack of input validation in key functions""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the lack of input validation but does not explicitly mention the frontrunning attack or the specific exploit involving the `to` address.

---

#### **[H-14] Anyone Can Arbitrarily Mint Fungible Tokens In VaderPoolV2.mintFungible()**

**Report Description**:  
The `mintFungible()` function is callable by any user and does not validate the `to` address. An attacker can frontrun a victim's transaction and mint LP tokens to their own address, stealing the victim's deposits.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Lack of input validation in key functions""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the lack of input validation but does not explicitly mention the frontrunning attack or the specific exploit involving the `to` address.

---

#### **[H-21] Lack of access control allow attacker to mintFungible() and mintSynth() with other user's wallet balance**

**Report Description**:  
The `mintFungible()` and `mintSynth()` functions lack access control, allowing attackers to use other users' wallet balances to mint tokens.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Lack of input validation in key functions""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the lack of input validation but does not explicitly mention the lack of access control or the specific exploit involving other users' wallet balances.

---

#### **[H-22] mintSynth() and burnSynth() can be front run**

**Report Description**:  
The `mintSynth()` and `burnSynth()` functions are vulnerable to frontrunning attacks, allowing attackers to manipulate the transaction outcome.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential front-running in liquidity provision/removal""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue of frontrunning in `mintSynth` and `burnSynth` functions, aligning with the issue report.

---

#### **[H-29] VaderPoolV2.mintFungible exposes users to unlimited slippage**

**Report Description**:  
The `mintFungible()` function does not allow users to specify a minimum number of liquidity units they will accept. Frontrunners can manipulate the pool's reserves to devalue the LP's contribution, resulting in fewer liquidity units than expected.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Lack of slippage protection in swap operations""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue of missing slippage protection in `mintFungible`, aligning with the issue report.

---

Function `consult()`, arithmetic issue

https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-vader/blob/3a43059e33d549f03b021d6b417b7eeba66cf62e/contracts/twap/TwapOracle.sol#L156
On L156 of TwapOracle we perform the calculation: ```
result = ((sumUSD * IERC20Metadata(token).decimals()) / sumNative);
```
This seems extremely odd as for an 18 decimal token we're then calculating
result = ((sumUSD * 18) / sumNative);

This is just plain weird. I expect what was meant is to replace this line with the below so we're properly scaling for token's number of decimals.
uint256 scalingFactor = 10 ** IERC20Metadata(token).decimals()
result = (sumUSD * scalingFactor) / sumNative;

Marked as high severity as this exchange rate appears to be used in some form of minting mechanism and correctness of the oracle is listed as one of the key focuses of the audit.

tUSDInUSDV can be smaller than tUSDInVader, and then getRate will return 0. This will lead wrong rate calculation.

 [H-17] TWAPOracle might register with wrong token order

Submitted by cmichel
The TWAPOracle.registerPair function takes in a factory and (token0, token1). The function accepts a _factory argument which means any Uniswap-like factory can be used.
When using the actual Uniswap factory's IUniswapV2Factory(factory).getPair(token0, token1) call, it could be that the token0 and token1 are reversed as it ignores the order.
Meaning, the price0/1CumulativeLast could also be reversed as it matches the internal order. The code however pushes the _pairs assuming that the internal price0CumulativeLast, price1CumulativeLast order matches the order of the function arguments token0, token1.
  [H-28] Incorrect Price Consultation Results

Submitted by leastwood
Impact

The TwapOracle.consult() function iterates over all token pairs which belong to either VADER or USDV` and then calculates the price of the respective asset by using both UniswapV2 and Chainlink price data. This helps to further protect against price manipulation attacks as the price is averaged out over the various registered token pairs.
Let's say we wanted to query the price of USDV, we would sum up any token pair where USDV == pairData.token0.
The sum consists of the following:
Price of USDV denominated in terms of token1 (USDV/token1).
Price of token1 denominated in terms of USD (token1/USD).
  [H-30] Newly Registered Assets Skew Consultation Results

Submitted by leastwood
Impact

The TwapOracle.consult() function iterates over all token pairs which belong to either VADER or USDV` and then calculates the price of the respective asset by using both UniswapV2 and Chainlink price data. This helps to further protect against price manipulation attacks as the price is averaged out over the various registered token pairs.
If a new asset is added by first registering the token pair and aggregator, the consultation result for that token pair will remain skewed until the next update interval. This is due to the fact that the native asset amount will return 0 due to the default price1Average value being used. However, the Chainlink oracle will return a valid result. As a result, the query will be skewed in favour of sumUSD resulting in incorrect consultations.
I'd classify this issue as high risk as the oracle returns false results upon being consulted. This can lead to issues in other areas of the protocol that use this data in performing sensitive actions
  [M-01] Unbounded loop in TwapOracle.update can result in oracle being locked

Function `TwapOracle.update`

Loss of ability of TwapOracle to update should too many pools be added.
Proof of Concept

TwapOracle allows an unlimited number of pairs to be added and has no way of removing pairs after the fact. At the same time `TwapOracle.update` iterates through all pairs in order to update value for each pair.
https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-vader/blob/3a43059e33d549f03b021d6b417b7eeba66cf62e/contracts/twap/TwapOracle.sol#L322-L369
TwapOracle.registerPair is a permissioned function so that only the owner can add new pairs however should the owner account be compromised or not mindful of the number of pairs being added it is possible to put the oracle into a state in which it is unable to update. The oracle cannot recover from this state
  [M-03] Permissioned nature of TwapOracle allows owner to manipulate oracle

Function `update`

https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-vader/blob/3a43059e33d549f03b021d6b417b7eeba66cf62e/contracts/twap/TwapOracle.sol#L322
Only the owner of TwapOracle can call update on the oracle. Should the owner desire they could cease calling update on the oracle for a period. Over this period the relative prices of VADER and USDC will vary.
After some period timeElapsed the owner can call update again. A TWAP is a lagging indicator and due to the owner ceasing to update the oracle so timeElapsed will be very large, therefore we're averaging over a long period into the past resulting in a value which may not be representative of the current USDV:VADER exchange rate.
  [M-18] TWAPOracle.getRate does not scale the ratio

Submitted by cmichel
The TWAPOracle.getRate function simply performs an integer division to compute the rate.
function getRate() public view returns (uint256 result) {
    uint256 tUSDInUSDV = consult(USDV);
    uint256 tUSDInVader = consult(VADER);
    // @audit shouldn't this scale by 1e18 first? otherwise easily 0
    result = tUSDInUSDV / tUSDInVader;
}
  [M-19] Unclear TwapOracle.consult algorithm

Submitted by cmichel
The TWAPOracle.consult function is unclear to the auditor. It seems to iterate through all registered pairs that share the token parameter (USDV or VADER) and then sums up the foreign token pair per token price. And divides this sum (sumNative) by the summed-up USD price of these foreign token pairs (sumUSD).
I think the idea is to create some kind of average price but doing it like this does not seem to be effective because large prices are weighted a lot stronger than low prices.

}

Based on my analysis, the TwapOracle contract is a sophisticated price oracle system for the Vader Protocol. It combines time-weighted average pricing from DEX liquidity pools with Chainlink price data to provide reliable token conversion rates. 

Several potential security concerns are noted in the ""Questions"" section, particularly around edge cases in price calculations, potential manipulation risks in low-liquidity pairs, and the handling of various failure modes in external price sources. The contract is also highly dependent on owner-controlled functions for initialization and maintenance, creating centralization risks.","I've analyzed the provided findings and consolidated similar issues while preserving key information. Here's the summary of security issues for the TwapOracle contract:

{
  ""Findings"": [
    {
      ""Issue"": ""Price Manipulation Vulnerability"",
      ""Severity"": ""Critical"",
      ""Description"": ""The contract is susceptible to price manipulation through flash loan attacks, low liquidity pairs, or timing of updates. The TWAP mechanism provides some protection, but the update frequency may not be sufficient to prevent sophisticated attacks. The consult() function calculates prices by averaging across registered pairs without properly weighting them based on liquidity or implementing adequate safeguards against manipulation."",
      ""Impact"": ""Attackers could manipulate liquidity in registered pairs to artificially influence price calculations, potentially leading to incorrect exchange rates, token valuations, and financial losses in systems relying on this oracle for pricing information."",
      ""Location"": ""consult() function, update() function, TWAP calculation mechanism""
    },
    {
      ""Issue"": ""Division by Zero Risk"",
      ""Severity"": ""High"",
      ""Description"": ""Multiple functions lack proper validation to prevent division by zero errors. In consult(), despite checking sumNative != 0 at the end, there's risk if no valid pairs are found. In getRate(), the function divides tUSDInUSDV by tUSDInVader without checking if tUSDInVader is zero."",
      ""Impact"": ""Division by zero would cause transactions to revert, making the oracle unavailable in critical situations. All functions dependent on getRate() (such as usdvtoVader and vaderToUsdv) would fail, causing denial of service for core protocol functionality."",
      ""Location"": ""consult() function, getRate() function""

    {
      ""Issue"": ""Stale Price Data Risk"",
      ""Severity"": ""High"",
      ""Description"": ""The contract lacks mechanisms to ensure up-to-date price data. The update() function can only be called by the owner, and while it requires minimum time to have passed, there's no upper limit on how stale data can be. While the contract checks for stale Chainlink prices, it doesn't properly handle the scenario where its own TWAP data becomes stale."",
      ""Impact"": ""If the owner fails to call update() regularly, the oracle could serve outdated price data, leading to mispriced tokens and potential economic exploits. Dependent protocols could operate based on outdated information, potentially causing financial losses."",

      ""Description"": ""The vaderToUsdv() function has two different logic paths depending on whether _usdvEnabled is true or false. When disabled, it uses direct price lookup via consult(), but when enabled, it uses getRate(). This inconsistency could lead to sudden price changes when the flag is switched."",
      ""Impact"": ""When the owner calls enableUSDV(), there could be a sudden change in conversion rates, potentially allowing for front-running attacks or creating arbitrage opportunities. Users might receive significantly different amounts of USDV depending on the state of the _usdvEnabled flag."",

---

#### **[H-04] TwapOracle doesn't calculate VADER:USDV exchange rate correctly**

**Report Description**:  
The `consult()` function in `TwapOracle` incorrectly calculates the exchange rate by multiplying `sumUSD` with the token's decimals directly (`sumUSD * IERC20Metadata(token).decimals()`). This is incorrect because it should scale `sumUSD` by `10 ** IERC20Metadata(token).decimals()` instead. This issue is marked as high severity because the exchange rate is used in a minting mechanism, and the correctness of the oracle is a key focus of the audit.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Precision Loss in Arithmetic Operations""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the issue of precision loss in arithmetic operations, which is related to the incorrect calculation in `consult()`. However, it does not explicitly address the specific problem of using `decimals()` directly instead of scaling by `10 ** decimals`. The response is partially correct because it captures the broader issue of arithmetic precision but misses the specific implementation error.

---

#### **[H-08] USDV and VADER rate can be wrong**

**Report Description**:  
The `getRate()` function divides `tUSDInUSDV` by `tUSDInVader` without ensuring `tUSDInVader` is non-zero. This can lead to division by zero errors and incorrect rate calculations, especially when `tUSDInVader` is smaller than `tUSDInUSDV`.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Division by Zero Risk""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the risk of division by zero in the `getRate()` function. It correctly explains the impact of this issue, which aligns with the report's description. The response fully addresses the vulnerability.

---

#### **[H-17] TWAPOracle might register with wrong token order**

**Report Description**:  
The `TWAPOracle.registerPair` function does not account for the possibility that `token0` and `token1` might be reversed in the Uniswap factory's `getPair` call. This can lead to incorrect `price0CumulativeLast` and `price1CumulativeLast` values, resulting in inaccurate price calculations.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The problem of token order reversal in `registerPair` is not covered in any of the responses.

---

#### **[H-28] Incorrect Price Consultation Results**

**Report Description**:  
The `TwapOracle.consult()` function iterates over all token pairs and calculates prices by summing up the prices of `USDV` and `VADER` denominated in other tokens. However, the logic for summing and averaging these prices is unclear and may lead to incorrect results.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Price Manipulation Vulnerability""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the broader issue of price manipulation and incorrect price calculations in `consult()`. However, it does not specifically address the unclear logic for summing and averaging prices. The response is partially correct because it captures the general problem but misses the specific implementation details.

---

#### **[H-30] Newly Registered Assets Skew Consultation Results**

**Report Description**:  
When a new asset is registered, the `consult()` function may return skewed results because the `price1Average` value defaults to zero until the next update interval. This can lead to incorrect consultations, especially when Chainlink oracles return valid results.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Stale Price Data Risk""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the risk of stale price data, which is related to the issue of skewed consultation results for newly registered assets. However, it does not explicitly address the specific problem of default `price1Average` values. The response is partially correct because it captures the broader issue but misses the specific implementation detail.

---

#### **[M-01] Unbounded loop in TwapOracle.update can result in oracle being locked**

**Report Description**:  
The `TwapOracle.update` function iterates over all registered pairs, and if too many pairs are added, the function may run out of gas, locking the oracle. This is a medium-severity issue because it can be exploited by adding a large number of pairs.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The problem of unbounded loops in `update` is not covered in any of the responses.

---

#### **[M-03] Permissioned nature of TwapOracle allows owner to manipulate oracle**

**Report Description**:  
The `TwapOracle.update` function can only be called by the owner, and the owner can manipulate the oracle by ceasing to call `update` for a period. This can lead to outdated or incorrect price data.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Centralization Risk in Oracle Management""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the centralization risk and the potential for the owner to manipulate the oracle by controlling the `update` function. The response fully addresses the vulnerability.

---

#### **[M-18] TWAPOracle.getRate does not scale the ratio**

**Report Description**:  
The `getRate()` function performs integer division without scaling the ratio by `1e18`, which can lead to incorrect results, especially when `tUSDInVader` is small.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Precision Loss in Arithmetic Operations""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response identifies the issue of precision loss in arithmetic operations, which includes the problem of unscaled division in `getRate()`. The response fully addresses the vulnerability.

---

#### **[M-19] Unclear TwapOracle.consult algorithm**

**Report Description**:  
The `consult()` function's algorithm is unclear, and it seems to weight large prices more heavily than low prices, which may not be effective for creating an average price.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Price Manipulation Vulnerability""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the broader issue of price manipulation and incorrect price calculations in `consult()`. However, it does not specifically address the unclear weighting algorithm. The response is partially correct because it captures the general problem but misses the specific implementation details.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:

- **[H-08] USDV and VADER rate can be wrong**
- **[M-03] Permissioned nature of TwapOracle allows owner to manipulate oracle**
- **[M-18] TWAPOracle.getRate does not scale the ratio**

**Partially Correct Matches**:

- **[H-04] TwapOracle doesn't calculate VADER:USDV exchange rate correctly**
- **[H-28] Incorrect Price Consultation Results**
- **[H-30] Newly Registered Assets Skew Consultation Results**
- **[M-19] Unclear TwapOracle.consult algorithm**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:

- **[H-17] TWAPOracle might register with wrong token order**
- **[M-01] Unbounded loop in TwapOracle.update can result in oracle being locked**

--- 

**Conclusion**:  
The response list covers many of the issues but misses some critical vulnerabilities, such as the unbounded loop in `update` and the token order reversal in `registerPair`. Additionally, some responses are partially correct, as they capture the broader issue but miss specific implementation details.","```
1. Division by Zero Risk

3. Precision Loss in Arithmetic Operations
```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the ranks of the true positives in the ranked list of predictions**:
   - **Division by Zero Risk**: Rank 2
   - **Centralization Risk in Oracle Management**: Rank 8
   - **Precision Loss in Arithmetic Operations**: Rank 7

2. **Calculate the precision at each rank**:
   - **Precision at rank 2 (P@2)**: \( \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \)
   - **Precision at rank 7 (P@7)**: \( \frac{2}{7} \approx 0.2857 \)

function `calculateLoss()`

The VaderPool would compensate users' IL. The formula it uses to calculate lp value is vulnerable to manipulation.
The formula to calculate the lp value is similar to warp finance which is known to be unsafe. warpfinance-incident-root-cause-analysis (Please to refer to the POC section)
The Attacker can purchase an old lp position, manipulate price, take IL compensation and drain the reserve. I consider this is a high-risk issue.
Proof of Concept

VaderMath.sol#L69-L93
The lp value is calculated as [(A0 * P1) + V0] and // [(A1 * P1) + V1]. Assume that there's an ETH pool and there's 100 ETH and 100 Vader in the pool.
Attacker deposit 1 ETH and 1 Vader and own 1% of the liquidity.
Wait 1 year
Start flash loan and buy a lot ETH with 99900 Vader.
There's 0.1 ETH 100,000 Vader in the pool.
Burn 1 % lp at the price 1 ETH = 1,000,000 Vader.
A0 * P1 + V0 = 1 (eth) * 1,000,000 (price) + 100 (vader)
A1 * P1 + V1 = 0.001 (eth) * 1,000,000 (price) + 10,000 (vader)
IL compensation would be around 9891000.
 [H-25] Wrong design of swap() results in unexpected and unfavorable outputs

Submitted by WatchPug
The current formula to calculate the amountOut for a swap is:
https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-vader/blob/429970427b4dc65e37808d7116b9de27e395ce0c/contracts/dex/math/VaderMath.sol#L99-L111
function calculateSwap(
    uint256 amountIn,
    uint256 reserveIn,
    uint256 reserveOut
) public pure returns (uint256 amountOut) {
    // x * Y * X
    uint256 numerator = amountIn * reserveIn * reserveOut;

    // (x + X) ^ 2
    uint256 denominator = pow(amountIn + reserveIn);

    amountOut = numerator / denominator;
}

We believe the design (the formula) is wrong and it will result in unexpected and unfavorable outputs.
Specifically, if the amountIn is larger than the reserveIn, the amountOut starts to decrease.

Looking beyond the JSON response, I'd note that this appears to be implementing a custom AMM formula which differs from the standard Uniswap x*y=k model. The slip adjustment calculations suggest this is designed to minimize impermanent loss or slippage under certain conditions.

**[H-10] calculateLoss is vulnerable to flashloan attack**

**Report Description**:
The `calculateLoss()` function in the VaderPool is vulnerable to a flashloan attack. The formula used to calculate the LP value is similar to the one exploited in the Warp Finance incident. An attacker can purchase an old LP position, manipulate the price, take impermanent loss (IL) compensation, and drain the reserve. This is a high-risk issue. The proof of concept demonstrates how an attacker can manipulate the pool's reserves to extract significant IL compensation.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Logical Flaw in calculateLoss Function""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies a logical flaw in the `calculateLoss` function but does not explicitly mention the flashloan attack vector or the specific manipulation of LP values. While it correctly points out the mathematical unsoundness of the formula, it misses the critical detail of how this flaw can be exploited via flashloans, which is the core of the reported issue.

---

**[H-25] Wrong design of swap() results in unexpected and unfavorable outputs**

**Report Description**:
The `swap()` function uses a flawed formula to calculate `amountOut`. Specifically, if `amountIn` is larger than `reserveIn`, the `amountOut` starts to decrease, leading to unexpected and unfavorable outputs. This design flaw can result in incorrect swap rates and potential economic exploitation.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the specific issue with the `swap()` function's formula. The reported issue highlights a critical design flaw that could lead to unfavorable swap outcomes, but this is not covered in the response list.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:
- **[H-10] calculateLoss is vulnerable to flashloan attack**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:
- **[H-25] Wrong design of swap() results in unexpected and unfavorable outputs**

---

### **Conclusion**
The response list partially addresses one of the two issues in the report but misses the critical details of the flashloan attack vector in the `calculateLoss` function. Additionally, it completely overlooks the design flaw in the `swap()` function, which is a significant vulnerability. The response list needs to be expanded to cover these gaps for a more comprehensive security assessment.","```

Submitted by Reigada

In the contract BasePool the mint function can be frontrun. This will assign the NFT to the attacker which later on he can burn it retrieving the corresponding \_nativeAsset and \_foreignAsset initially deposited by the frontrun victim. https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-vader/blob/main/contracts/dex/pool/BasePool.sol#L149-L194
 [H-20] Early user can break addLiquidity

Submitted by WatchPug
https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-vader/blob/429970427b4dc65e37808d7116b9de27e395ce0c/contracts/dex/pool/BasePool.sol#L161-L163
uint256 totalLiquidityUnits = totalSupply;
if (totalLiquidityUnits == 0)
    liquidity = nativeDeposit; // TODO: Contact ThorChain on proper approach

In the current implementation, the first liquidity takes the nativeDeposit amount and uses it directly.
However, since this number (totalLiquidityUnits) will later be used for computing the liquidity issued for future addLiquidity using calculateLiquidityUnits.
A malicious user can add liquidity with only 1 wei USDV and making it nearly impossible for future users to add liquidity to the pool.
  [M-13] BasePool.mint() Is Callable By Anyone

Submitted by leastwood
Impact

The BasePool.mint() function differs from its implementation in BasePoolV2.mint() in which it lacks an onlyRouter modifier. This ensures that users cannot call this function directly as VaderRouter.addLiquidity() performs some necessary input validation which can be bypassed by directly calling BasePool.mint().

#### **[H-11] (dex-v1) BasePool.mint() function can be frontrun**

**Report Description**:  
The `mint` function in `BasePool` is vulnerable to frontrunning. An attacker can frontrun a victim's transaction, minting an NFT that assigns ownership to the attacker. Later, the attacker can burn the NFT to retrieve the deposited `_nativeAsset` and `_foreignAsset`, effectively stealing the victim's funds.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Mint function vulnerable to token theft""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the frontrunning vulnerability in the `mint` function. It explains how attackers can exploit the lack of verification on token senders, leading to token theft. This aligns with the issue's description and impact.

---

#### **[H-20] Early user can break addLiquidity**

**Report Description**:  
The `addLiquidity` function in `BasePool` assigns the first liquidity provider's deposit directly to `liquidity` without proper calculation. A malicious user can deposit `1 wei` of `USDV`, making it nearly impossible for future users to add liquidity due to the flawed calculation mechanism.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Incorrect liquidity calculation for first deposit""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the issue with the first deposit's liquidity calculation but does not explicitly mention the potential for a malicious user to exploit this by depositing a minimal amount. The impact is partially covered, but the specific exploit scenario is missed.

---

#### **[M-13] BasePool.mint() Is Callable By Anyone**

**Report Description**:  
The `mint` function in `BasePool` lacks the `onlyRouter` modifier, allowing anyone to call it directly. This bypasses the input validation performed by `VaderRouter.addLiquidity()`, potentially leading to improper usage.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of missing access control in the `mint` function. This is a critical oversight, as it allows unauthorized users to bypass necessary validation checks.

---

#### **[M-14] BasePool.swap() Is Callable By Anyone**

**Report Description**:  
The `swap` function in `BasePool` lacks the `onlyRouter` modifier, allowing anyone to call it directly. This bypasses the input validation performed by `VaderRouter._swap()`, potentially leading to improper usage.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of missing access control in the `swap` function. This is a critical oversight, as it allows unauthorized users to bypass necessary validation checks.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:  
- **[H-11] (dex-v1) BasePool.mint() function can be frontrun**

**Partially Correct Matches**:  
- **[H-20] Early user can break addLiquidity**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:  
- **[M-13] BasePool.mint() Is Callable By Anyone**  
- **[M-14] BasePool.swap() Is Callable By Anyone**

---

### **Overall Assessment**  
The response list covers some of the issues but misses critical vulnerabilities related to access control in the `mint` and `swap` functions. Additionally, the description of the liquidity calculation issue is partially correct but lacks the specific exploit scenario. Improvements are needed to ensure comprehensive coverage of all identified vulnerabilities.","```
1. Mint function vulnerable to token theft
```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the rank of the true positive**:
   - The true positive is ""Mint function vulnerable to token theft"".
   - This issue appears at rank 2 in the ranked list of predictions.

2. **Calculate the precision at that rank**:
   - Precision at rank 2 (\( P@2 \)) is calculated as the number of true positives up to rank 2 divided by the rank itself.
   - Since there is only one true positive up to rank 2, \( P@2 = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

3. **Compute the Average Precision (AP)**:
   - Since there is only one true positive, the AP is simply the precision at the rank where the true positive appears.
   - Therefore, \( AP = 0.5 \).

**Output**:
```
0.5

Impact

Function `createPool` is a permissionless transaction.
Anyone can create a token pool.
Token price is set by the first lp provider.
User can get a synthetic asset.
Assume a new popular coin that the DAO decides to add to the protocol. The attacker can create the pool and set it to be extremely cheap. (By depositing 1 wei coin and 10^18 wei Vader.) The attacker can mint a lot of synth by providing another 10^18 wei Vader.

Based on my analysis, this contract is a factory for creating liquidity pools that always include a designated native asset as one of the pair tokens. The contract follows standard factory pattern practices but has some potential constraints and security considerations worth noting, including strict validation that one token must be the native asset and administrative functions restricted to the DAO/owner.","I've analyzed the input data to identify, combine similar issues, and format them according to the requirements.

**Report Description**:
The `createPool` function is permissionless, allowing anyone to create a token pool. The token price is set by the first liquidity provider. An attacker can exploit this by front-running the creation of a pool for a new popular coin added by the DAO. By depositing a minimal amount of the new coin (e.g., 1 wei) and a large amount of Vader (e.g., 10^18 wei), the attacker can set the price of the synthetic asset to be extremely cheap. This allows the attacker to mint a large amount of synth by providing another 10^18 wei of Vader, potentially destabilizing the protocol.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Unrestricted Pool Creation""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response correctly identifies that the `createPool` function is accessible to anyone without access control, which aligns with the issue's description of permissionless pool creation. However, the response does not address the specific exploit scenario where an attacker can front-run the creation of a pool to set an artificially low price for a synthetic asset. The response focuses on the potential for spam and blockchain bloat but misses the critical financial impact and manipulation risk described in the issue. Therefore, while the response partially covers the issue, it does not fully capture the severity or the specific exploit mechanism.

**Correct Matches**:
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:
- **[H-12] Attacker can get extremely cheap synth by front-running create Pool**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:
- *None*

This evaluation highlights that while the response list partially addresses the issue, it does not fully capture the exploit's financial impact and manipulation risk. The response could be improved by explicitly mentioning the potential for price manipulation and the specific risks associated with front-running in the context of pool creation.","```

",2501,343,"[H-15] VaderRouter._swap performs wrong swap

Submitted by cmichel
The 3-path hop in VaderRouter._swap is supposed to first swap foreign assets to native assets, and then the received native assets to different foreign assets again.
The pool.swap(nativeAmountIn, foreignAmountIn) accepts the foreign amount as the second argument. The code however mixes these positional arguments up and tries to perform a pool0 foreign -> native swap by using the foreign amount as the native amount:
function _swap(
    uint256 amountIn,
    address[] calldata path,
    address to
) private returns (uint256 amountOut) {
    if (path.length == 3) {

      // @audit calls this with nativeAmountIn = amountIn. but should be foreignAmountIn (second arg)
      return pool1.swap(0, pool0.swap(amountIn, 0, address(pool1)), to);
    }
}

// @audit should be this instead
return pool1.swap(pool0.swap(0, amountIn, address(pool1)), 0, to);

**Report Description**:
The `_swap` function in `VaderRouter` incorrectly handles the 3-path hop swap. Specifically, the function is supposed to first swap foreign assets to native assets and then swap the received native assets to different foreign assets. However, the function incorrectly passes the `amountIn` as the first argument to `pool0.swap`, which should be the second argument (foreign amount). This results in a swap that uses the foreign amount as the native amount, leading to incorrect swap behavior.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the specific issue of incorrect argument ordering in the `_swap` function. The issue is unique to the logic of the 3-path hop swap and is not covered by any of the findings in the response list.

### **[H-16] VaderRouter.calculateOutGivenIn calculates wrong swap**

**Report Description**:
The `calculateOutGivenIn` function in `VaderRouter` incorrectly calculates the swap for a 3-path hop. The function is supposed to first swap foreign assets to native assets in `pool0` and then swap the received native assets to different foreign assets in `pool1`. However, the function incorrectly swaps in `pool1` first instead of `pool0`, leading to incorrect calculations.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the specific issue of incorrect swap order in the `calculateOutGivenIn` function. This issue is unique to the logic of the 3-path hop calculation and is not covered by any of the findings in the response list.
