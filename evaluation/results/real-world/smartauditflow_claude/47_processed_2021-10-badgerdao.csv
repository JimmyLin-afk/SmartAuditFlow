",1204,156,"[H-01] The design of wibBTC is not fully compatible with the current Curve StableSwap pool
 variables `wibBTC`
Per the documentation, variables `wibBTC` is designed for a Curve StableSwap pool. However, the design of wibBTC makes the balances change dynamically and automatically. This is unusual for an ERC20 token, and it's not fully compatible with the current Curve StableSwap pool.
Specifically, a Curve StableSwap pool will maintain the balances of its coins based on the amount of tokens added, removed, and exchanged each time. In another word, it can not adopt the dynamic changes of the balances that happened automatically.
The pool's actual dynamic balance of wibBTC will deviate from the recorded balance in the pool contract as the pricePerShare increases.
Furthermore, there is no such way in Curve StableSwap similar to the sync() function of UNI v2, which will force sync the stored reserves to match the balances.
  [H-02] Approved spender can spend too many tokens

The `approve` function has not been overridden and therefore uses the internal shares, whereas transfer(From) uses the rebalanced amount.
Impact

The approved spender may spend more tokens than desired. In fact, the approved amount that can be transferred keeps growing with pricePerShare.
Many contracts also use the same amount for the approve call as for the amount they want to have transferred in a subsequent transferFrom call, and in this case, they approve an amount that is too large (as the approved shares amount yields a higher rebalanced amount).

[H-04] WrappedIbbtc and WrappedIbbtcEth contracts do not filter out price feed outliers

If price feed is manipulated in any way or there is any malfunction based volatility on the market, both contracts will pass it on a user. In the same time it's possible to construct mitigation mechanics for such cases, so user economics would be affected by sustainable price movements only. As price outrages provide a substantial attack surface for the project it's worth adding some complexity to the implementation.
 [M-01] Unable to transfer WrappedIbbtc if Oracle go down

In function `WrappedIbbtc`, user will not be able to transfer if `oracle.pricePerShare()` (L124) revert. This is because balanceToShares() is called in both transfer and transferFrom, which included a call to pricePerShare().
If this is the expected behavior, note that WrappedIbbtcEth is behaving the opposite as it uses the cached value in a local variable pricePerShare, which is only updated upon call to updatePricePerShare().
 [M-02] Null check in pricePerShare

Submitted by hack3r-0m, also found by defsec
oracle can 0 as a price of the share, in that case, 0 will be the denominator in some calculations which can cause reverts from SafeMath (for e.g here: WrappedIbbtc.sol L148) resulting in Denial Of Service.
WrappedIbbtcEth.sol L73
WrappedIbbtc.sol L123
  [M-03] hard to clear balance
Function `transfer()`
The contract does not allow users to transfer by share. Therefore, It is hard for users to clear out all the shares. There will be users using this token with Metamask and it is likely the pricePerShare would increase after the user sends transactions. I consider this is a medium-risk issue.

[M-04] No sanity check on pricePerShare might lead to lost value

Function `sharesOf`
`pricePerShare` is read either from an oracle or from ibBTC's core.
If one of these is bugged or exploited, there are no safety checks to prevent loss of funds.

Key Observations and Rationale:
1. The task list covers comprehensive security, functional, and economic aspects of the contract.
2. Each area addresses specific risks identified in the initial code review.
3. Tasks are designed to be specific, actionable, and focused on potential vulnerabilities.
4. The breakdown considers both technical implementation and economic design considerations.

Recommended Next Steps:
- Conduct a detailed review following these task categories
- Use static analysis tools to complement manual review
- Perform comprehensive testing across different scenarios
- Consider formal verification for critical mathematical conversions

The task list provides a structured approach to auditing the WrappedIbbtc contract, ensuring a thorough examination of its security, functionality, and economic design.","I've thoroughly reviewed the provided smart contract code. Here's my detailed analysis:

{
  ""Findings"": [
    {
      ""Issue"": ""Oracle manipulation vulnerability and centralization risk"",
      ""Severity"": ""Critical"",
      ""Description"": ""The contract relies entirely on an external oracle for determining the pricePerShare(), which affects all balance calculations and transfers. There is no sanity check or circuit breaker to protect against extreme price changes or oracle manipulation. The oracle can be changed by governance without any timelock or validation, creating a centralization risk since all token functionality depends on this price feed."",
      ""Impact"": ""A compromised or manipulated oracle could dramatically alter the relative value of shares, allowing malicious actors to extract value from the system through mispriced mints, burns, or transfers. Since all token value calculations depend on this price, the entire system's integrity rests on the oracle's accuracy. Users' token values could be manipulated by governance through oracle manipulation."",
      ""Location"": ""pricePerShare() function and all functions that rely on it (balanceOf, totalSupply, balanceToShares, sharesToBalance), setOracle() function""
    },
    {
      ""Issue"": ""Incorrect ERC20 transfer/transferFrom implementation"",
      ""Severity"": ""High"",
      ""Description"": ""Both transfer() and transferFrom() functions convert the input amount to shares using balanceToShares before transferring, creating a non-standard ERC20 behavior. Users specify an amount in token value, but the contract transfers shares worth that amount instead. This creates a mismatch between what users expect to transfer (in value terms) and what is actually transferred (in shares), violating the ERC20 standard expectation that the amount parameter is the exact amount to transfer."",
      ""Impact"": ""Users may transfer different amounts than intended, potentially leading to financial losses. For example, due to price rounding, a user requesting to transfer 10 tokens might actually transfer 9.98 or 10.02 tokens worth of shares. Integration with other protocols expecting standard ERC20 behavior will malfunction. DApps and interfaces may display incorrect balances, and this could enable front-running attacks where an attacker manipulates the price just before a transfer."",
      ""Location"": ""transfer() and transferFrom() functions""
    },
    {
      ""Issue"": ""Missing approve override with inconsistent behavior"",
      ""Severity"": ""High"",
      ""Description"": ""The contract overrides transfer and transferFrom but not approve. This creates an inconsistency in the token behavior since the allowance is in shares but users would think it's in value terms (as with transfer functions). This mismatch can lead to unintended behavior when using approvals."",
      ""Impact"": ""Approvals may not work as expected, potentially leading to higher or lower spending allowances than intended, causing unexpected behavior in protocols that integrate with this token."",
      ""Location"": ""Missing override for approve() function""

    {
      ""Issue"": ""Improper price precision handling and decimal normalization"",
      ""Severity"": ""Medium"",
      ""Description"": ""The contract performs multiplications before divisions in several functions when converting between shares and balances, which could lead to precision loss or even rounding to zero. It assumes both the wrapped token and ibbtc have 18 decimals when performing calculations with pricePerShare (using 1e18 divisor), but this is not verified. If any of these assumptions are incorrect, calculations will be wrong."",
      ""Impact"": ""Users might lose funds due to rounding errors, especially for small transfer amounts when pricePerShare is high. Incorrect value calculations can lead to improper token amounts being minted, burned, or transferred if the underlying ibBTC token has different decimals than expected."",

If the price per share changes between transaction submission and execution, users might receive fewer tokens than expected. There is no mechanism to protect them from price changes during transaction processing."",

While the standard ERC20 implementation shouldn't be vulnerable to reentrancy, custom token implementations might be exploitable. These functions don't use reentrancy guards."",
      ""Impact"": ""If the ibbtc token has callbacks or allows reentrancy, an attacker might be able to exploit the mint() or burn() functions to manipulate the contract state in unexpected ways, potentially allowing double-minting or other exploits."",

After setting pendingGovernance, there's no timelock or way to cancel the governance transfer if the wrong address was specified."",
      ""Impact"": ""If the governance address is compromised, an attacker could immediately change the oracle to a malicious implementation, potentially draining all value from the system.

---

#### **[H-01] The design of wibBTC is not fully compatible with the current Curve StableSwap pool**

**Report Description**:  
The design of `wibBTC` makes balances change dynamically and automatically, which is unusual for an ERC20 token and incompatible with the Curve StableSwap pool. The pool maintains balances based on token additions, removals, and exchanges, but cannot handle automatic balance changes. This discrepancy causes the actual dynamic balance of `wibBTC` to deviate from the recorded balance in the pool contract as `pricePerShare` increases. Additionally, there is no mechanism like UNI v2's `sync()` function to force synchronization of stored reserves with actual balances.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the incompatibility between `wibBTC`'s dynamic balance design and the Curve StableSwap pool. This is a critical issue that could lead to significant discrepancies in token balances and potential exploitation.

---

#### **[H-02] Approved spender can spend too many tokens**

**Report Description**:  
The `approve` function has not been overridden and uses internal `shares`, while `transfer(From)` uses the rebalanced amount. This mismatch allows an approved spender to spend more tokens than intended, as the approved amount grows with `pricePerShare`. Many contracts use the same amount for `approve` and `transferFrom`, leading to excessive approvals.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Missing approve override with inconsistent behavior""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue with the `approve` function not being overridden, leading to inconsistent behavior between `approve` and `transfer(From)`. It correctly explains the risks of excessive spending allowances, aligning with the issue description.

---

#### **[H-04] WrappedIbbtc and WrappedIbbtcEth contracts do not filter out price feed outliers**

**Report Description**:  
The contracts do not filter out price feed outliers, allowing manipulated or malfunctioning price feeds to directly affect users. This creates a substantial attack surface, as sustainable price movements are not distinguished from outliers.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Oracle manipulation vulnerability and centralization risk""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the reliance on an external oracle and the risks of manipulation but does not explicitly mention the lack of outlier filtering or mitigation mechanics. The issue is partially addressed but misses critical details.

---

#### **[M-01] Unable to transfer WrappedIbbtc if Oracle goes down**

**Report Description**:  
Users cannot transfer `WrappedIbbtc` if `oracle.pricePerShare()` reverts, as `balanceToShares()` is called in both `transfer` and `transferFrom`. This contrasts with `WrappedIbbtcEth`, which uses a cached `pricePerShare` value updated only upon calling `updatePricePerShare()`.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of transfer functionality being blocked if the oracle goes down. This is a medium-risk issue that could lead to user frustration and potential loss of functionality.

---

#### **[M-02] Null check in pricePerShare**

**Report Description**:  
The oracle can return `0` as the price of a share, leading to division by zero in calculations (e.g., `WrappedIbbtc.sol` L148) and causing reverts from SafeMath, resulting in Denial of Service.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Improper price precision handling and decimal normalization""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response mentions precision handling and decimal normalization but does not explicitly address the risk of `pricePerShare` being `0` and causing division by zero. The issue is partially covered but misses a critical detail.

---

#### **[M-03] Hard to clear balance**

**Report Description**:  
The contract does not allow users to transfer by share, making it difficult to clear out all shares. As `pricePerShare` increases, users may not be able to transfer their entire balance, especially when using tools like Metamask.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of users being unable to clear their balances due to the lack of share-based transfers. This is a medium-risk usability issue.

---

#### **[M-04] No sanity check on pricePerShare might lead to lost value**

**Report Description**:  
`pricePerShare` is read from an oracle or `ibBTC`'s core without sanity checks. If either is bugged or exploited, there are no safeguards to prevent loss of funds.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Oracle manipulation vulnerability and centralization risk""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the reliance on an external oracle and the risks of manipulation but does not explicitly mention the lack of sanity checks on `pricePerShare`. The issue is partially addressed but misses critical details.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:

- **[H-02] Approved spender can spend too many tokens**

**Partially Correct Matches**:

- **[H-04] WrappedIbbtc and WrappedIbbtcEth contracts do not filter out price feed outliers**
- **[M-02] Null check in pricePerShare**
- **[M-04] No sanity check on pricePerShare might lead to lost value**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:

- **[H-01] The design of wibBTC is not fully compatible with the current Curve StableSwap pool**
- **[M-01] Unable to transfer WrappedIbbtc if Oracle goes down**
- **[M-03] Hard to clear balance**

The response list covers some issues but misses critical vulnerabilities and risks, particularly those related to compatibility with Curve StableSwap, oracle downtime, and user balance management. Additionally, some issues are only partially addressed, leaving gaps in the analysis and proposed solutions.","```
1. Missing approve override with inconsistent behavior
```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the rank of the true positive**:
   - The true positive is ""Missing approve override with inconsistent behavior"".
   - From the ranked list of predictions, this issue appears at rank 4.

2. **Calculate the precision at rank 4 (P@4)**:
   - Precision at rank 4 is the number of true positives up to rank 4 divided by 4.
   - Since there is only one true positive up to rank 4, \( P@4 = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \).

3. **Compute the Average Precision (AP)**:
   - Since there is only one true positive, the AP is simply the precision at the rank where the true positive appears.
   - Therefore, \( AP = 0.25 \).

**Output**:
```
0.25

Malicious user can monitor `SetPricePerShare` event and, if it was run long enough time ago and market moved, but, since there were no SetPricePerShare fired, the contract's pricePerShare is outdated, so a user can mint() with pricePerShare that is current for contract, but outdated for market, then wait for price update and burn() with updated pricePerShare, yielding risk-free profit at expense of contract holdings.

If price feed is manipulated in any way or there is any malfunction based volatility on the market, both contracts will pass it on a user.

  ]
}

After reviewing this code, I can provide some additional observations:

This contract implements a ""wrapper"" over the ibBTC token that uses a share-based accounting system to represent value. The key mechanism is tracking users' ownership in terms of ""shares,"" while presenting an external interface that uses value terms. The price per share increases over time as the underlying ibBTC accrues interest/value.

The contract has a notable design where the transfer functions accept a value-based amount but internally convert and track this as shares. This means users can transfer specific values, even as the underlying share value fluctuates.

Important security considerations include:
1. Reliance on the Core contract's pricePerShare value
2. Lack of automatic price updates during operations
3. Potential precision issues when converting between shares and balances
4. The two-step governance pattern is well-implemented
5. The contract follows the upgradeable proxy pattern, suggesting it can be updated if issues are found

Overall, this appears to be a well-structured contract implementing a ""rebasing"" token through a share-based mechanism, though there are some questions about operational details and potential edge cases.","After analyzing the provided input, I've consolidated similar issues and structured them according to severity.

They convert input 'amount' to shares before transferring, but this conversion creates inconsistent behavior because users expect to transfer the amount they specify, not a converted value. This breaks ERC20 standard expectations and can lead to unexpected token transfers. The functions accept an amount parameter but interpret it as a token balance rather than the intended share amount."",
      ""Impact"": ""Users will transfer different amounts than they intended. The UI or any application interacting with this contract may show one value, but a different amount will be transferred.

}",395.5826597213745,46453.0,32.0,"### **[H-03] WrappedIbbtcEth contract will use stalled price for mint/burn if updatePricePerShare wasn't run properly**

**Report Description**:
The `WrappedIbbtcEth` contract relies on the `updatePricePerShare` function to update the `pricePerShare` value. If this function is not called regularly, the `pricePerShare` value becomes outdated. A malicious user can monitor the `SetPricePerShare` event and, if the price is outdated, mint tokens at the stale price. Once the price is updated, the user can burn the tokens at the updated price, yielding a risk-free profit at the expense of the contract holdings. This vulnerability arises due to the lack of enforced regular updates to `pricePerShare`.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Price Per Share Manipulation""**.

**Validation**:
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue with the reliance on external updates for `pricePerShare` and the potential for economic attacks due to stale prices. It correctly explains the risks associated with outdated `pricePerShare` values, which aligns with the issue described in the report. The response also highlights the impact on minting and burning operations, which is consistent with the report's concerns.

### **[H-04] WrappedIbbtc and WrappedIbbtcEth contracts do not filter out price feed outliers**

**Report Description**:
The `WrappedIbbtc` and `WrappedIbbtcEth` contracts do not implement any mechanism to filter out price feed outliers. If the price feed is manipulated or experiences market volatility, the contracts will pass these anomalies directly to users. This creates a substantial attack surface, as malicious actors could exploit price outliers to manipulate the system. Implementing mitigation mechanics to ensure that only sustainable price movements affect user economics would reduce this risk.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of price feed outliers or the lack of filtering mechanisms in the `WrappedIbbtc` and `WrappedIbbtcEth` contracts. This is a significant gap, as the issue highlights a critical vulnerability that could be exploited by malicious actors. The absence of any mention of this issue in the response list indicates a missed opportunity to address a key security concern.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:

- **[H-03] WrappedIbbtcEth contract will use stalled price for mint/burn if updatePricePerShare wasn't run properly**

**Partially Correct Matches**:

- *None*

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:

- **[H-04] WrappedIbbtc and WrappedIbbtcEth contracts do not filter out price feed outliers**

---

### **Conclusion**

The response list effectively addresses the issue of stale `pricePerShare` values in the `WrappedIbbtcEth` contract, providing a correct and thorough analysis of the risks and impacts. However, it fails to identify or address the issue of price feed outliers in both the `WrappedIbbtc` and `WrappedIbbtcEth` contracts, which represents a significant security gap. Future analyses should ensure that all critical vulnerabilities, including those related to price feed manipulation, are adequately covered.","```
1. Price Per Share Manipulation
```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the rank of the true positive**:
   - The true positive is ""Price Per Share Manipulation"".
   - In the ranked list of predictions, ""Price Per Share Manipulation"" appears at **rank 2**.

2. **Calculate the precision at rank 2**:
   - Precision at rank 2 (\( P@2 \)) is the number of true positives up to rank 2 divided by 2.
   - Since there is only one true positive up to rank 2, \( P@2 = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

3. **Compute the Average Precision (AP)**:
   - Since there is only one true positive, the AP is simply the precision at the rank where the true positive appears.
   - Therefore, \( AP = 0.5 \).

**Output**:
```
0.5
