When a user tries to swap unwrapped ETH to ERC20, even if there is a certain amount of ETH refunded, at L215, ethDelta will always be 0.
That's because originalETHBalance already includes the msg.value sent by the caller.
Let's say the ETH balance of the contract is 1 ETH before the swap.
A user swaps 10 ETH to USDC;
originalETHBalance will be 11 ETH;
If there is 1 ETH of refund;
ethDelta will be 0 as the new balance is 2 ETH and subOrZero(2, 11) is 0.
Similarly, erc20Delta is also computed wrong.
Consider a special case of a user trying to arbitrage from WBTC to WBTC, the originalERC20Balance already includes the input amount, erc20Delta will always be much lower than the actual delta amount.
For example, for an arb swap from 1 WBTC to 1.1 WBTC, the ethDelta will be 0.1 WBTC while it should be 1.1 WBTC.
 [M-01] Swap.sol implements potentially dangerous transfer


The use of `transfer()` in  Swap.sol may have unintended outcomes on the eth being sent to the receiver. Eth may be irretrievable or undelivered if the msg.sender or feeRecipient is a smart contract. Funds can potentially be lost if;
The smart contract fails to implement the payable fallback function
The fallback function uses more than 2300 gas units
The latter situation may occur in the instance of gas cost changes. The impact would mean that any contracts receiving funds would potentially be unable to retrieve funds from the swap.   [M-02] Unused ERC20 tokens are not refunded

Submitted by WatchPug
Based on the context and comments in the code, we assume that it's possible that there will be some leftover sell tokens, not only when users are selling unwrapped ETH but also for ERC20 tokens.
However, in the current implementation, only refunded ETH is returned (L158).
Because of this, the leftover tkoens may be left in the contract unintentionally.
 
[M-03] Users can avoid paying fees for ETH swaps

Users can call `Swap.swapByQuote()` to execute an ETH swap (where they receive ETH) without paying swap fee for the gained ETH. They can trick the system by setting zrxBuyTokenAddress to an address of a malicious contract and making it think they have executed an ERC20 swap when they have actually executed an ETH swap. In this case, the system will give them the ETH they got from the swap (boughtETHAmount) without charging any swap fees for it, because the systems consideres this ETH as ""refunded ETH"" that wasn't part of the ""ERC20"" swap.

**Report Description**:
The `fillZrxQuote()` function in `Swap.sol` makes an arbitrary contract call to `zrxTo` with user-supplied calldata (`zrxData`). This allows an attacker to craft malicious calldata, such as a `transferFrom` call, to steal ERC20 tokens from users' wallets if they have previously approved the contract. This vulnerability arises because the function does not validate the `zrxTo` address or the calldata, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary operations.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Unsafe External Call Risk""**.

**Validation**:
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the risk of arbitrary external calls in the `fillZrxQuote` function. It highlights the potential for malicious actors to craft call data that performs unexpected operations, which aligns with the issue's description of attackers stealing ERC20 tokens. The response also correctly emphasizes the lack of validation for the `zrxTo` address and calldata, which is the core of the vulnerability.

---

### **[H-02] Wrong calculation of `erc20Delta` and `ethDelta`**

**Report Description**:
The `fillZrxQuote()` function incorrectly calculates `erc20Delta` and `ethDelta` by using balance differences. For ETH swaps, `ethDelta` is always `0` because `originalETHBalance` includes the `msg.value` sent by the caller. Similarly, for ERC20 swaps, `originalERC20Balance` includes the input amount, leading to incorrect delta calculations. This can result in users receiving less than expected or incorrect accounting of token balances.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Insufficient Validation of External Swap Results""**.

**Validation**:
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the issue with balance-based calculations and mentions the vulnerability to manipulation. However, it does not explicitly address the specific problem of `ethDelta` and `erc20Delta` being incorrectly calculated due to `originalETHBalance` and `originalERC20Balance` including the input amounts. The response focuses more on manipulation risks rather than the core calculation error.

---

### **[M-01] Swap.sol implements potentially dangerous transfer**

**Report Description**:
The use of `transfer()` in `Swap.sol` may lead to unintended outcomes when sending ETH to smart contracts. If the recipient contract's fallback function requires more than 2300 gas or is not implemented, the ETH transfer may fail, potentially resulting in lost funds. This issue is particularly relevant for contracts that rely on receiving ETH.

**Match in Response List**:
Matches with the issue titled **""Unchecked ETH Transfer in sweepFees""**.

**Validation**:
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the risks associated with using `transfer()` for ETH transfers, particularly when the recipient is a contract. It correctly highlights the potential for transfers to fail if the recipient contract lacks a proper fallback function or requires more than 2300 gas, which aligns with the issue's description.

---

### **[M-02] Unused ERC20 tokens are not refunded**

**Report Description**:
The current implementation of `Swap.sol` does not refund unused ERC20 tokens after a swap. Only refunded ETH is returned, leaving leftover ERC20 tokens unintentionally in the contract. This oversight can lead to funds being locked in the contract, especially when users swap ERC20 tokens.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The issue highlights a significant oversight in the contract's handling of unused ERC20 tokens, which is not covered in the response list.

---

### **[M-03] Users can avoid paying fees for ETH swaps**

**Report Description**:
Users can exploit the `Swap.swapByQuote()` function to avoid paying swap fees for ETH swaps. By setting `zrxBuyTokenAddress` to a malicious contract, users can trick the system into treating the swap as an ERC20 swap, allowing them to receive ETH without paying fees. This is because the system considers the ETH as ""refunded ETH"" rather than part of the swap.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The issue describes a specific exploit where users can bypass swap fees for ETH swaps, which is not covered in the response list.

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:
- **[H-01] Arbitrary contract call allows attackers to steal ERC20 from users' wallets**
- **[M-01] Swap.sol implements potentially dangerous transfer**

**Partially Correct Matches**:
- **[H-02] Wrong calculation of `erc20Delta` and `ethDelta`**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:
- **[M-02] Unused ERC20 tokens are not refunded**
- **[M-03] Users can avoid paying fees for ETH swaps**

---

The response list effectively addresses some critical issues but misses or partially covers others, particularly those related to fee avoidance and unused token refunds. Improvements are needed to ensure comprehensive coverage of all identified vulnerabilities.","```

```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the ranks of the true positives in the ranked list of predictions**:
   - ""Unsafe External Call Risk"" appears at rank 1.
   - ""Unchecked ETH Transfer in sweepFees"" appears at rank 5.

2. **Calculate the precision at each rank where a true positive appears**:
   - For rank 1: \( P@1 = \frac{1}{1} = 1.0 \)
   - For rank 5: \( P@5 = \frac{2}{5} = 0.4 \)

3. **Average the precision values**:
   - \( AP = \frac{1.0 + 0.4}{2} = 0.7 \)

**Average Precision (AP)**: 0.7"
