}",3357,388,"[H-01] Can force borrower to pay huge interest
In the function `lend()`, the loan amount is used as a min loan amount. It can be matched as high as possible (realistically up to the collateral NFT's worth to remain in profit) and the borrower has to pay interest on the entire amount instead of just on the desired loan amount when the loan was created.
  [H-02] currentLoanOwner can manipulate loanInfo when any lenders try to buyout
If an attacker already calls `lend()` to lend to a loan, the attacker can manipulate `loanInfo` by reentrancy attack when any lenders try to buyout. The attacker can set bad values of lendInfo (e.g. very long duration, and 0 interest rate) that the lender who wants to buyout don't expect.

[H-03] Borrower can be their own lender and steal funds from buyout due to reentrancy
If borrower lends their own loan, they can repay and close the loan before ownership of the lend ticket is transferred to the new lender. The borrower will keep the NFT + loan amount + accrued interest.  [M-01] When an attacker lends to a loan, the attacker can trigger DoS that any lenders can not buyout it
If an attacker (lender) lends to a loan, the attacker can always revert transactions when any lenders try to buyout, making anyone can not buyout the loan of the attacker.   [M-02] Protocol doesn't handle fee on transfer tokens
Since the borrower is able to specify any asset token, it is possible that loans will be created with tokens that support fee on transfer. If a fee on transfer asset token is chosen, the protocol will contain a point of failure on the original `lend()` call.

[M-03] sendCollateralTo is unchecked in closeLoan(), which can cause user's collateral NFT to be frozen
The `sendCollateralTo` will receive the collateral NFT when `closeLoan()` is called. However, if `sendCollateralTo` is a contract address that does not support ERC721, the collateral NFT can be frozen in the contract.   [M-04] `requiredImprovementRate` can not work as expected when `previousInterestRate` less than 10 due to precision loss   [M-05] Borrowers lose funds if they call `repayAndCloseLoan` instead of `closeLoan`
The `repayAndCloseLoan` function does not revert if there has not been a lender for a loan (matched with `lend`). Users should use closeLoan in this case but the contract should disallow calling `repayAndCloseLoan` because users can lose funds.
It performs a `ERC20(loan.loanAssetContractAddress).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, lender, interest + loan.loanAmount)` call where interest will be a high value accumulated from timestamp 0 and the loan.loanAmount is the initially desired min loan amount `minLoanAmount` set in `createLoan`. The user will lose these funds if they ever approved the contract (for example, for another loan).

[M-06] Might not get desired min loan amount if _originationFeeRate changes
Admins can update the origination fee by calling `updateOriginationFeeRate`. Note that a borrower does not receive their `minLoanAmount` set in createLoan, they only receive `(1 - originationFee) * minLoanAmount`, see lend. Therefore, they need to precalculate the `minLoanAmount` using the `current` origination fee to arrive at the post-fee amount that they actually receive. If admins then increase the fee, the borrower receives fewer funds than required to cover their rent and might become homeless.
  [M-07] `mintBorrowTicketTo` can be a contract with no `onERC721Received` method, which may cause the `BorrowTicket NFT` to be frozen and put users' funds at risk

**[H-01] Can force borrower to pay huge interest**

**Report Description**:  
In the function `lend()`, the loan amount is used as a min loan amount. It can be matched as high as possible (realistically up to the collateral NFT's worth to remain in profit), and the borrower has to pay interest on the entire amount instead of just on the desired loan amount when the loan was created.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The issue is not addressed in the `response_list`. The response list does not cover the specific risk of borrowers being forced to pay interest on inflated loan amounts due to the design of the `lend()` function.

---

**[H-02] currentLoanOwner can manipulate loanInfo when any lenders try to buyout**

**Report Description**:  
If an attacker already calls `lend()` to lend to a loan, the attacker can manipulate `loanInfo` by reentrancy attack when any lenders try to buyout. The attacker can set bad values of `lendInfo` (e.g., very long duration and 0 interest rate) that the lender who wants to buyout doesn't expect.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Reentrancy Vulnerability in External Calls""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the reentrancy vulnerability in external calls, which aligns with the issue described. The impact of reentrancy attacks on loan state manipulation is correctly highlighted.

---

**[H-03] Borrower can be their own lender and steal funds from buyout due to reentrancy**

**Report Description**:  
If the borrower lends their own loan, they can repay and close the loan before ownership of the lend ticket is transferred to the new lender. The borrower will keep the NFT + loan amount + accrued interest.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Reentrancy Vulnerability in External Calls""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response correctly identifies the reentrancy vulnerability, which is the core issue here. The potential for borrowers to exploit reentrancy to steal funds is covered.

---

**[M-01] When an attacker lends to a loan, the attacker can trigger DoS that any lenders can not buyout it**

**Report Description**:  
If an attacker (lender) lends to a loan, the attacker can always revert transactions when any lenders try to buyout, making it impossible for anyone to buyout the loan of the attacker.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The issue is not addressed in the `response_list`. The response list does not cover the specific risk of DoS attacks by malicious lenders.

---

**[M-02] Protocol doesn't handle fee on transfer tokens**

**Report Description**:  
Since the borrower is able to specify any asset token, it is possible that loans will be created with tokens that support fee on transfer. If a fee on transfer asset token is chosen, the protocol will contain a point of failure on the original `lend()` call.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The issue is not addressed in the `response_list`. The response list does not cover the specific risk of fee-on-transfer tokens causing failures in the protocol.

---

**[M-03] sendCollateralTo is unchecked in closeLoan(), which can cause user's collateral NFT to be frozen**

**Report Description**:  
The `sendCollateralTo` will receive the collateral NFT when `closeLoan()` is called. However, if `sendCollateralTo` is a contract address that does not support ERC721, the collateral NFT can be frozen in the contract.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Insufficient Input Validation""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the lack of input validation, which is related to the issue. However, it does not specifically address the risk of NFTs being frozen due to unsupported ERC721 contracts.

---

**[M-04] requiredImprovementRate can not work as expected when previousInterestRate less than 10 due to precision loss**

**Report Description**:  
The `requiredImprovementRate` cannot work as expected when `previousInterestRate` is less than 10 due to precision loss.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Precision Loss in Interest Calculations""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response accurately identifies the issue of precision loss in calculations, which aligns with the described problem.

---

**[M-05] Borrowers lose funds if they call repayAndCloseLoan instead of closeLoan**

**Report Description**:  
The `repayAndCloseLoan` function does not revert if there has not been a lender for a loan (matched with `lend`). Users should use `closeLoan` in this case, but the contract should disallow calling `repayAndCloseLoan` because users can lose funds. It performs a `ERC20(loan.loanAssetContractAddress).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, lender, interest + loan.loanAmount)` call where `interest` will be a high value accumulated from timestamp 0 and the `loan.loanAmount` is the initially desired min loan amount `minLoanAmount` set in `createLoan`. The user will lose these funds if they ever approved the contract (for example, for another loan).

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Reentrancy Vulnerability in External Calls""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies reentrancy vulnerabilities, which are related to the issue. However, it does not specifically address the risk of users losing funds due to incorrect function usage.

---

**[M-06] Might not get desired min loan amount if _originationFeeRate changes**

**Report Description**:  
Admins can update the origination fee by calling `updateOriginationFeeRate`. Note that a borrower does not receive their `minLoanAmount` set in `createLoan`; they only receive `(1 - originationFee) * minLoanAmount`, see `lend`. Therefore, they need to precalculate the `minLoanAmount` using the `current` origination fee to arrive at the post-fee amount that they actually receive. If admins then increase the fee, the borrower receives fewer funds than required to cover their rent and might become homeless.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The issue is not addressed in the `response_list`. The response list does not cover the specific risk of borrowers receiving fewer funds due to changes in origination fees.

---

**[M-07] mintBorrowTicketTo can be a contract with no onERC721Received method, which may cause the BorrowTicket NFT to be frozen and put users' funds at risk**

**Report Description**:  
`IERC721Mintable(borrowTicketContract).mint(mintBorrowTicketTo, id);`

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Insufficient Input Validation""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the lack of input validation, which is related to the issue. However, it does not specifically address the risk of NFTs being frozen due to unsupported ERC721 contracts.
