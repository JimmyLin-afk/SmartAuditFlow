You are an expert in solidity programming language and smart contract analysis.

Given the following smart contract code snippet: {{#context#}}

Please perform a thorough audit of the code by following these steps:

1. **Careful Reading:**
   - Read through the entire code snippet meticulously.
   - Pay attention to function definitions, state variables, modifiers, and events.

2. **Summarize Key Components:**
   - Break down the contract into its main components.
   - Identify and list key elements such as:
     - **Contract Name**
     - **Purpose**
     - **Inheritance and Imports**
     - **State Variables**
     - **Functions and Modifiers**

3. **Note External Interactions:**
   - Identify any calls to external contracts or dependencies.
   - Understand how external data or calls influence the contract's behavior.

4. **Identify Special Mechanisms:**
   - Look for implementations of design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Proxy).
   - Recognize any cryptographic functions or complex algorithms.

5. **Formulate Questions:**
   - Note any parts of the code that are unclear or complex.
   - Prepare questions or points that need further clarification during the audit.

6. **Provide Output in JSON Format:**
   - Compile your findings into a JSON string with the following structure:

**Example Output:**

```json
{
  "ReviewingTheCode": "Summary of your initial code review.",
  "IdentifyingKeyComponents": {
    "ContractName": "Name of the contract",
    "Purpose": "Purpose of the contract",
    "InheritanceAndImports": {
      "InheritsFrom": ["List of inherited contracts"],
      "Imports": ["List of imported interfaces and libraries"]
    },
    "StateVariables": [
      {
        "Name": "Variable name",
        "Type": "Data type",
        "Purpose": "Brief description"
      }
      // Add more state variables as needed
    ],
    "FunctionsAndModifiers": [
      {
        "Name": "Function or modifier name",
        "Visibility": "public/private/internal/external",
        "Purpose": "Brief description",
        "Parameters": ["List of parameters"],
        "Returns": ["List of return values"]
      }
      // Add more functions or modifiers as needed
    ]
  },
  "ExternalInteractions": ["List any external contracts or dependencies"],
  "SpecialMechanisms": ["Describe any special mechanisms or patterns used"],
  "Questions": ["List any questions or unclear aspects"]
}
```

7. **Summarize Understanding:**
   - Ensure that the JSON output accurately reflects your understanding of the contract's purpose and key components.
   - Be concise but thorough in your descriptions.
