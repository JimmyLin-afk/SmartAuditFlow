**SmartAuditFlow** is a dynamic and adaptive framework for automated smart contract auditing, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and workflow-driven strategies to deliver reliable, precise, and scalable security analysis.

## Overview

**SmartAuditFlow** addresses these limitations by orchestrating LLMs within a structured, multi-stage workflow, enabling dynamic audit plan generation, iterative reasoning, and integration of external tools for enhanced vulnerability detection.

Key innovations include:

* **Dynamic audit plan customization** for each contract.
* **Iterative execution and refinement** of audit strategies based on intermediate findings.
* **Structured reasoning** and **prompt optimization** to improve LLM performance.
* **Integration with static analyzers** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for contextual enrichment.

This framework is inspired by the [Plan-and-Solve](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.147.pdf) paper as well as the [Baby-AGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) project.

The core idea is to first come up with a multi-step plan, and then go through that plan one item at a time. After accomplishing a particular task, you can then revisit the plan and modify as appropriate.

The general computational graph looks like the following:

This compares to a typical [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) style agent where you think one step at a time. The advantages of this "plan-and-execute" style agent are:

Explicit long term planning (which even really strong LLMs can struggle with)
Ability to use smaller/weaker models for the execution step, only using larger/better models for the planning step
