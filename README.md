## 🌟 What is SmartAuditFlow?

SmartAuditFlow addresses key limitations in smart contract auditing by orchestrating LLMs within a structured, multi-stage workflow, enabling:

* **Dynamic audit plan customization** for each contract.
* **Iterative execution and refinement** of audit strategies based on intermediate findings.
* **Structured reasoning** and **prompt optimization** to improve LLM performance.
* **Integration with static analyzers** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for contextual enrichment.

### 🔍 Core Concept

This framework is inspired by the [Plan-and-Solve](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.147.pdf) paper as well as the [Baby-AGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) project.

The framework follows a "plan-and-execute" approach:
1. Create a multi-step audit plan
2. Execute tasks sequentially
3. Refine plan based on intermediate findings

### 🚀 Advantages Over Traditional Methods

This compares to a typical [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) style agent where you think one step at a time. The advantages of this "plan-and-execute" style agent are:

Explicit long term planning (which even really strong LLMs can struggle with)
Ability to use smaller/weaker models for the execution step, only using larger/better models for the planning step
